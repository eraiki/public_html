Additional emphasis that this is not a quick start for newbies, with
pointers to various tutorials; also cleaned up the small links
collection near the end (skip the link to the "best of" archive --
Jari's tips page covers most of that anyway; include a link to
Infinite Ink's Quick Start)

Most explicit references to 3.11pre7 and 3.12 now updated for 3.13.1
but still not done an exhaustive check. But the bugs section in
particular should now be reasonably up to date, and the

Finally managed to fix the bug which has been producing empty change
histories in the announcement that gets posted to the mailing list

Felt bold enough to finally take out "draft" from "draft FAQ". (It's
not more finished now than a week or a month ago, but I don't expect
it ever to be ...)

Also, elaborated a little more on lock files, fixed a couple of typos,
polished the prose in some places, linked in the updated formail -r
page -- and included two new appendices with a little help from my
friends on the list (thanks to Sean Straw, and special thanks to
Bennett Todd for the maildir format description)

Rehashed the csh gripes a little in light of recent discussions on the
list.

SENDMAILFLAGS goes in quoted by the ! action.  Put this in the
"quirks" section although I guess Dattier is rightfully calling this a
bug. (archive/latest/18600, &#60;199808191833.NAA01028@Mercury.mcs.net&#62;)

I'm going on honeymoon tomorrow morning :-) so this is all the updates
for this release of the FAQ, I'm afraid. See you in September!
