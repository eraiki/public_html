If you came here because you received spam or "fan mail" ostensibly from me
(probably in Spanish, perhaps from some misconfigured server in Brazil),
it was forged by a spammer who also tried to subscribe me to countless
mailing lists, and who has mailbombed me repeatedly.
<p>
(Pause). It's good to see that my spam complaints actually sometimes
make a difference. Please join the fight against the vandals --
register as a supporter of CAUCE or EuroCAUCE!
<p>
I might add more information about this incident here eventually.
This notice has been here for a while already, but the bomber comes back
every once in a while, so I'd better leave this up permanently.
Thank you for your attention.

<h2>
What's in here
</h2>
<p>
Right now, a bit of a mess
as I'm restructuring my pages.
I am also in the process of recovering
from the loss of not one but two servers,
one of which was my web server,
and the other which held the backups :-/
Thanks to <a href="http://web.archive.org/">web.archive.org</a>
for making backups of many of my pages.
Some of them have been lost, though.
I still have them in CVS but I might
not be able to recover them anyway,
because parts of the ad-hoc
build system I was using has
suffered bad bit-rot.
(Lesson: Don't roll your own,
even if it's 1995 and no
decent free Unix tools
are available yet.)
<p>
Try
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?as%5Fq=era&amp;as%5Focct=url&amp;as%5Fsitesearch=www.iki.fi">a Google search for this site</a>
to get an overview of what
might or might not
still be available here.
<h2>
What's not in here
</h2>
<p>
I've removed my
contact information
because I'm paranoid.
Try the
<a href="feedback.html">feedback form</a>
if you are
desperate to reach me.
(Actually, that's one of
the lost pages, so don't click,
it's not there any longer,
and/or yet.)
<p>
I receive about
300 pieces of spam
for every legitimate
piece of email.
Thus I have <em>heavy</em>
spam filtering
in place.
Even if you are
able to infer a
working address
from the URL of
this page,
for example
(which isn't necessarily
as straightforward
as you might imagine),
you are unlikely
to get through
if you are not
already on my
personal whitelist,
in which case you
should already
know my address.
<p>
Unsolicited
binary attachments
are not welcome
even from people
I know and respect.
Thank you for
your consideration.
