<h1>Mailing Lists Related to Procmail and SmartList</h1>
<p>
<p>
This web page describes the various public mailing lists related to
Procmail and SmartList.
<h2>
How to Subscribe
</h2>
<p>
The basic instructions for how to add (and remove) yourself are
the same regardless of which particular list you are interested
in.
This section uses
<code>procmail@informatik.RWTH-Aachen.de</code> as an example.
If you want to join a different list, substitute its name as appropriate.
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>
Subscribing
</strong>
<dd>
To join the list, send mail to
<blockquote>
<a href="mailto:procmail-request@informatik.rwth-aachen.de?subject=subscribe"><code>procmail-request@informatik.RWTH-Aachen.de</code></a>
</blockquote>
with the word "subscribe" in the Subject: header.
(No quotes, of course.)
<dt>
<strong>
Unsubscribing
</strong>
<dd>
To remove yourself from the list, send mail to
<blockquote>
<a href="mailto:procmail-request@informatik.rwth-aachen.de?subject=unsubscribe"><code>procmail-request@informatik.RWTH-Aachen.de</code></a>
</blockquote>
with the word "unsubscribe" in the Subject: header.
(No quotes, of course.)
<dt>
<strong>
Posting
</strong>
<dd>
To send a message to all the other subscribers, send it to
<blockquote>
<a href="mailto:procmail@informatik.rwth-aachen.de"><code>procmail@informatik.RWTH-Aachen.de</code></a>
</blockquote>
<dd>
Please <strong>don't send unsubscribe requests</strong> to the
list's broadcast address.
Many of the subscribers will get annoyed at you for wasting their time
if you do. They can't remove you from the list.
<dd>
Other netiquette tips:
<ul>
<li>	Use a descriptive Subject: (not just "procmail" or "help")
<li>	Find out whether there is a FAQ before posting, and don't
post questions which are answered in the FAQ
<li>	Only post from a functional address -- no spam foiling
<li>	Turn off any HTML or Richtext features in your mail program.
Don't post attachments.
<li>	Keep in mind that the lists' readers are subscribers just
like you. Nobody gets paid for monitoring the lists or
answering questions.
<li>	If you describe a problem, please be as specific as possible.
Include all the diagnostics you can think of. If there's a lot
of material (log files, recipes, tests, examples) you might
want to put them on a web page and just post an URL and
a summary to the list.
</ul>
<dt>
<strong>
In case of trouble
</strong>
<dd>
You can send pleas for help to the -request address
if you have problems with the list (unable to unsubscribe
in spite of following the instructions, etc).

<h2>
History
</h2>
<p>
The original Procmail and SmartList mailing lists were hosted at the 
Technical University of Aachen (RWTH Aachen) in Germany
by Stephen van den Berg, the original creator of Procmail and SmartList.
<p>
The domain <code>procmail.org</code> was created in late 1998
as a new home for the Procmail development effort. A transition
of the various mailing lists to this domain was started, but has
not been finished yet.
<p>
As a matter of fact, the <code>procmail-users</code> addresses
unfortunately do not work yet, in spite of the fact that they
have been advertised publicly in some places.
The Aachen
list is still really at <code>procmail@informatik.rwth-aachen.de</code>
(and ditto ditto for SmartList-users@procmail.org / SmartList@aachen)
although this will change eventually.
<h2>
Miscellaneous
</h2>
<p>
Rhett Jones used to run an alternative Procmail list and a SmartList list, too.
These appear to be dead now.
<p>
There is no Usenet group dedicated to Procmail, but
<a href="news:comp.mail.misc"><code>comp.mail.misc</code></a>
gets a reasonable amount of Procmail-related traffic.
Various Unix groups occasionally have threads about Procmail, too.
