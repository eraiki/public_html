<h1>Procmail Links</h1>
<p>
To keep the <a href="mini-faq.html">Procmail FAQ</a> at a manageable size, I've opted to list 
only the most central web links in the FAQ itself. 
This page, then, is more of a kitchen-sink collection. 
<p>
The URL of this page is 
<a href="http://www.iki.fi/era/procmail/links.html">http://www.iki.fi/era/procmail/links.html</a>

The Procmail mailing list is a valuable resource and shock-full
of helpful and knowledgeable people. 
<a href="listhelp.txt">General help and subscribe/unsubscribe instructions are available </a>

There is also a (slightly tongue-in-cheek [NOT])
Unsubscribe FAQ by Sean Straw at

<a href="lists.html"><small>(local mirror)</small></a>
<br>
The list discussions are archived in part or in full at least
at the following sites:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de/mailing-lists/procmail">Achim Bohnet's HyperMail archive</a>
is definitely the most popular. Probably it's also the most
complete, going back to October 1995.
<li>
<a href="http://styra.lidac.liu.se/~bive/listor/">Link&ouml;ping University's MHonArc archive</a>
has a partial archive.
<li>
If you try searching on Alta Vista, there's 
an obnoxious archive at 
<a href="http://alt.venus.co.uk/">http://alt.venus.co.uk/</a>
which gives loads of hits but which never really seems to be up.
</ul>
If you are unable or unwilling to use the WWW archives, 
try to find a web-to-mail server (see the 
<a href="#useful-e-mail">"useful things by e-mail" links below)</a>
you can use. The Procmail listserv only stores a limited
number of the most recent messages. (If that's what you want,
mail the
<a href="mailto:procmail-request@informatik.rwth-aachen.de?subject=help">mailing list server</a>
with the word "help" in the <code>Subject:</code> line
and you'll get 
<a href="archive.txt">[somewhat terse] instructions</a>
for how to access the archive by e-mail.)
<ul>
<li>
The
<a href="#pearls">"Pearls" section below</a>
has some good tips from the mailing list.
<li>
The <a href="ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail/best%5Fof%5Fprocmail%5Flist.gz">Best of Procmail archive</a> compilation contains a wealth of
good tips (although some of them are wearing a bit old, 
the archive being from 1995. There's a
<a href="http://members.xoom.com/procmail/best-of-procmail-list/">surfable mirror in the Mirror Cupboard</a>
but it lacks an index and a search engine).
<li>
Jari Aalto has gathered
<a href="http://www.procmail.org/jari/pm-tips.html">his own "best of" compilation</a>
in one big happy HTML file (a 
<a href="http://www.procmail.org/jari/pm-tips.txt">text version also available).</a>

<a href="#ssjaaa">Jari's entry in the Rich and Famous section.</a>
</ul>
<li>
<a name="manpages">
Online copies of the Procmail manual pages are available from many places.
You can probably find a multitude of sites with a web-based manual page
server which have the Procmail pages -- try

or look at my crude text-only local copies from the 3.11pre7 distribution
(the various <tt>man2html</tt> hits you'll get on Alta Vista 
are not necessarily or even likely for the newest version):

The official Procmail site will naturally have a collection of related links
(small but focused; I believe all of them are also in this collection,
though).
<dt>
<a href="http://www.ii.com/internet/robots/procmail/">Infinite Ink's Procmail Page</a>
<dd>
This is a good switchboard site with links to all sorts 
of Procmail-related stuff. Again, in the below listing, I have tried to 
avoid duplicating links which are already available from 
the Infinite Ink page. Check it out. 
<dt>
<a href="http://www.spamfree.org/resources/procmail.html">FREE's Procmail Anti-Spam Links</a>

The
<a href="http://directory.mozilla.org/">Open Directory Project's</a>
matches on
<a href="http://directorysearch.mozilla.org/cgi-bin/search?search=procmail">Procmail</a>
constitute a good virtual link collection. The bulk of it is in their
<a href="http://directory.mozilla.org/Computers/Software/Internet/Clients/Mail/Unix/Procmail/">Procmail category.</a>
<dt>
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a>
has a similar directory, but it's IMHO not as well maintained.
<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=procmail">Still, try a search on "Procmail".</a>
</dl>
<p>
You can probably find some other useful sites by starting with this
<a href="http://www.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&amp;text=yes&amp;q=%2bprocmail+%2dhost%3adigiweb%2ecom+%2dhost%3auiuc%2eedu+%2dhost%3admt%2ecsiro%2eau+%2dhost%3amiranova%2ecom+%2dhost%3alidac%2eliu%2ese+%2dhost%3adigiweb%2eie+%2dhost%3avenus%2eco%2euk+%2dhost%3ampg%2ede+%2dhost%3akiruna%2ese+%2dhost%3awww%2eredhat%2ecom">canned Alta Vista search for "procmail".</a>
<br>
This merely attempts to strip out sites which have archives of the
Procmail mailing list and/or otherwise a lot of Procmail material, on 
the theory that if you've looked around a little bit you will already
have seen the stuff they can offer. What is left then is a very disparate
collection of lone Procmail-related pages
(presently, some 3,000 hits). 
<br>
In and of itself, this is not particularly useful; you should
refine the search to suit your needs before you actually use it. 
<br>
(Of course, in many situations, the mailing list archives contain
exactly the stuff you're looking for. This one is primarily useful if
you've been reading the Procmail mailing list yourself and are
looking for information you know is not in the archives. I managed to
find a couple of the Rich and Famous pages and a few of the tutorials
using variants of this. Caveat Utilitor: A lot of the stuff you find
will be very old.)
<h2>
<a name="tutorials">
Procmail Tutorials
</a></h2>
<p>
There are several good tutorials for Unix newbies, although many of them 
are more or less tied to the site where they were written. For the most 
part, these tutorials do not presuppose a lot of knowledge about Unix
or mail handling on Unix.
<p>
None of the material in the "howto" section is exactly rocket science, 
either -- let's just say it contains a lot less of this "pause now
if your head hurts already" nonsense.
<p>
If you're only interested in spam filtering, check out the
<a href="#antispam">spam-fighting section</a>
below instead.
<ul>
<li><b>Newbie-level material</b>
<br>
Many of the documents towards the end of this list
contain some minor glitches or inaccuracies. 
But they all have their merits when it comes to 
presenting the issues, and none of the examples
should be dangerous or anything.
(You might want to check out the
<a href="mini-faq.html#efficiency">pitfalls section of the FAQ</a>
for some typical problems if you'd like to try to figure out 
where they go wrong.)
<ul>
<li>
Infinite Ink's
<a href="http://www.ii.com/internet/robots/procmail/qs/">Procmail Quick Start</a>

tricky things with Procmail.
<p>
The Procmail pages in the

ftp-by-mail servers, etc. 
<p>
The
<a href="mini-faq.html">Mini-FAQ</a>
basically assumes you are somewhat familiar with the manuals
and with "normal" stuff people do with Procmail. It does have
an introductory section, though, and some tips for debugging 
your recipes.
<h2>
<a name="pearls">
Pearls from the Mailing List
</a></h2>
<p>
Here's a collection of pointers to good articles in the on-line
archives of the Procmail mailing list.
<p>
Many of these are answers to recurring questions, but above all,
all of them should be worth a look simply because they are good
examples of coding style and problem solving.
(Dsiclaimer: Okay, maybe not my own&nbsp;<code>:-)</code>
<p>
The archive server doesn't always manage to find all messages in
a thread, so if you get the feeling you are missing part of the
picture, you may want to dive up to the "Thread Index" for the
month you are looking at, and look for related messages.
<dl>
<dt>
<a name="match">
MATCH grabbing
</a><dd>
This is a useful trick to add to your toolbox.
Frequently, people use something like
<code>SUBJECT=`formail -XSubject:`</code>
when they would not need to call an external program
at all.
It's a simple optimization, although understanding
the syntax is a bit challenging if you haven't
worked a lot with Procmail's advanced constructs.
<dd>
The FAQ has a
<a href="mini-faq.html#pass-envar">short aside about this topic</a>
but you might want to look at the following
treatment of the subject from the mailing list:
<dd>
<a href="http://www.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de/mailing-lists/procmail/2000-02/msg00232.html">http://www.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de/mailing-lists/procmail/2000-02/msg00232.html</a>
(but do read the entire thread)
<dt>
<a name="pager">
Forwarding to a pager
</a><dd>
One of David Tamkin's classics; his
<a href="http://www.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de/mailing-lists/procmail/1997-03/msg00200.html">pager forwarding recipe.</a>
(You might also want to look at
<a href="http://www.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de/mailing-lists/procmail/1997-12/msg00125.html">http://www.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de/mailing-lists/procmail/1997-12/msg00125.html</a>
which is about chunking a long message into shorter pieces for a pager.
Another thread is at
<a href="http://www.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de/mailing-lists/procmail/1997-07/msg00167.html">http://www.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de/mailing-lists/procmail/1997-07/msg00167.html</a>
with some additional ideas about chunking messages.
The archive missed some follow-ups; look at the threaded index for
cues. Also check out the thread
<a href="http://www.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de/mailing-lists/procmail/1997-07/msg00325.html">"Condition with BODY length?")</a>
<dt>
<a name="copy-header">
How to reply with a copy of the headers you are replying to
</a><dd>
Another pearl by David: a <code>sed</code> script for sending
bounces which include the headers of the bounced message
<a href="http://www.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de/mailing-lists/procmail/1996-09/msg00071.html">(version 1</a>
and
<a href="http://www.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de/mailing-lists/procmail/1997-02/msg00203.html">version 2)</a>
<dt>
<a name="count-recipients">
Counting the number of recipients
</a><dd>
A frequently wanted item from the archives is the Canonical Recipe for
Counting the Number of Recipients. This is trickier than it seems at
first because you have to use <code>Resent-</code> headers if they
are present, and try to parse out the actual addresses from each line.

Spam-Fighting Tools
</a></h3>
<p>
Procmail makes for a very nice framework for filtering spam,
although your provider should also offer other front-line
defenses such as total blocking of all connections from
known spam factories.
<p>
If you are merely looking for a way to put Procmail to use
for blocking unwanted mail,
it's probably best to simply download one of the prepackaged
solutions listed here. 
<p>
Check out the link to Leah Roberts' link site 
<a href="#collections">above.</a>
Most of the below sites are listed there, and some other useful ones
as well.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/wj/wje/release/sg-howto">Spamgard(tm),</a>
a password-based spam deflector by Bill Evans.
<li>
Catherine A. Hampton's
<a href="http://www.spambouncer.org/">Spam Bouncer</a>
both bounces and auto-replies to unwanted mail.
<li>
Gregory Sutter's
<a href="http://www.pobox.com/~gsutter/junkfilter/">junkfilter</a>
reportedly catches 90-95% of the author's spam.
<li>
<a href="http://www.css.tayloru.edu/~bbell/spam-filter">Bob's Spam Filter</a>
comes with a pretty good introduction on setting up Procmail.
<li>
Steven Tucker's
<a href="http://www.nacs.net/~classics/procmail/">spamkill filter </a>
is easy to configure even without learning Procmail's language.
<li>
The Simple Procmail Anti-Spam Template, or
<a href="http://www.netnerds.net/spast/">SPAST</a>
by Chrissy LeMaire,
allows you to filter on keywords in files. Not the best possible approach,
but it makes it easy to get started.
<li>
Another package is 
<a href="ftp://boombox.micro.umn.edu/pub/spamtrap/">Spamtrap</a>
by Farhad Anklesaria, who describes it thus:
"nothing startlingly new here, just a convenient package that we are
using and that anyone else is welcome to."
<li>
<a href="http://www.css.tayloru.edu/~bbell/spam-filter">Bob's Spam Filter</a>
is pretty much run-of-the-mill, and requires some slight adaptation,
but it's simple and straightforward.
<li>
Walter Dnes'
<a href="http://www.interlog.com/~waltdnes/spamdunk/spamdunk.htm">Spamdunk</a>
is intended for Procmail newbies (and incidentally his pages include
a nice

for the Unix challenged).
<li>
Timo Salmi has created a passwording

<a name="nocem-e">
Don Doumakes has implemented
</a><a href="http://www.novia.net/~doumakes/abuse/">NoCeM for E-mail,</a>
a rather novel concept; when you come up with a good Procmail
recipe, you PGP sign it and send it off to a <tt>nocem-e</tt>

On the receiving end, you have software to automatically add recipes
from people you trust, with the option to add recipes from other
people manually.

Procmail recipes.
<li>

your own. This assumes you have already set up Procmail and understand
a bit of how it works. (You'll also probably want to request a copy of
Net Access' own filtering rules.)
<li>
<a href="http://www.telerama.com/">Telerama</a>
have a 
<a href="http://www.lm.com/procmail-sample.txt">simple score-based filter </a>

Spam, or unsolicited bulk e-mail, is an ubiquitous problem on today's

Among the entries in the

several are fairly newbie-oriented. Try the Filtering Mail FAQ for starters. 
<li>
The net is full of Unix-related pages, but it's hard to find something
reasonably newbie-oriented which still is general enough to be of
interest to Unix newbies everywhere. But try these:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/story/6254.html">A simple introduction to regular expressions</a>
from HotWired
<li>
A somewhat more involved (and accurate) one 
<a href="http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?regular+expression">from the Free On-Line Dictionary Of Computing</a>
<li>
<a href="http://www.herring.org/techie.html">Geek Speak</a>

local Procmail pages, too.

<li>
<a href="http://www.oase-shareware.org/shell/	">Heiner's Shelldorado</a>
-- lots of shell programming stuff and links.
</ul>
In general, look for information about shell programming,
regular expressions,

Any decent Unix beginners' book should treat both of the first topics 
rather thoroughly.

Other Assorted Information
</a></h3>
<p>
Here are links to other topics which might be of interest to the broad
Procmail-using public.
<p>
Many of the below documents are Usenet FAQs; when available, I've included 
a pointer to a primary site, but otherwise, I've used pointers to the WWW
FAQ archives at <code>faqs.org</code> (USA) and <code>ruu.nl</code> 
(the Netherlands) -- you should primarily use the one closer to you. 
If you are comfortable retreiving the FAQs by ftp instead, by all means 
use that and get them from your closest RTFM mirror. 
<br>
<small>
(In Internet topology, Australia and the Far East are generally closer to 
the US than to Europe. As for Africa and the Antarctic, I really don't know,
but I'd guess users from those continents, too, had better try the 
US sites first. YMMV.)
</small>
<p>
Other than FAQs, this is mostly link collections of all sorts.
If you find one that you think should be listed here, let me know.
