Yikes -- character class trick example in regex section was wrong.
Thanks to Rejo Zenger and Philip Guenther for the discussion on the
list.

here. (Anybody wanna volunteer?)

Terminology by fiat: ":0 flags:lock" thing is now called "colon line"
(David agreed with me, so this must be a good idea :-)

You can stack $ modifiers to force multiple substitution passes
(amazing, huh? Thanks to Philip for this revelation)

Corrected description of what happens when you set HOST to a bogus
value (I had this explained to me a long time ago by David Tamkin but
it slipped through the cracks at that time, sorry)

Action line: emphasize that action flags (c and friends) don't kick in
until the action is actually attempted

Action line: emphasize that if you want multiple actions, you need a
prelude line (and perhaps conditions, and flags) for each (and
probably a set of braces around the whole construct). [Possibly I
should have an example, too.]

Fleshed out some descriptions a bit; more on when to use and not use
lock files; exceeding LINEBUF can lead to crashes

Holger Wahlen's &#60;dl&#62; rendering hereby replaces the tables rendering I
had been using before.

Recent additions and fixes include a flesh-out of variable
substitution, including $\VAR and ${VAR:-value} and friends; the $#,
$$, $?, $_, and $- variables; empty action; slightly more on scoring

Generalized the modifiers section; slightly sick because the size and
var modifiers should be treated as such, too
