Subscription and unsubscription instructions for the Procmail mailing
list are included below.

  Newsflash / Nov 23 1999: Procmail 3.14 is out.

The Procmail Mini-FAQ and its companion Procmail Links page are
available at the following locations:

  Procmail Mini-FAQ: <http://www.iki.fi/era/procmail/mini-faq.html>
  Procmail Links:    <http://www.iki.fi/era/procmail/links.html>

Please view the Table of Contents for the FAQ near the end of this
posting. If you have a question about Procmail, you should hopefully
find it there.

The following mirror sites are available:

  <http://www.hartzler.net/smartlist/SmartList-FAQ.html>
        -- SmartList FAQ, now maintained by Peter Hartzler

The Links page, of course, has links to lots more.

If you would like to receive the FAQ by electronic mail, send a
message with the words "send mini-faq.txt" (sans quotation marks) in
the Subject: header to the address
    <era+pr@iki.fi>

The Links page is not very useful if you do not have WWW access. You
can receive the HTML version by e-mail, though; use the Subject line
"send links.html" instead. The HTML version of the FAQ can be
retreived with the Subject: send mini-faq.html

If you can't receive large messages, you can receive the text version
of the mini-FAQ in parts by requesting "mini-faq/parts" instead of
"mini-faq.txt".

My current plan is to send this out every 11 days and see how people
react. If nobody reacts in any way, I will probably continue to send
it out this way, and/or ultimately seek news.answers approval for this
notice.

     Yikes -- character class trick example in regex section was wrong.
     Thanks to Rejo Zenger and Philip Guenther for the discussion on the
     list.
     
  date: 1999/08/06
  
     Some minor tweaks, including a note that the options are not described
     here. (Anybody wanna volunteer?)


How to subscribe/unsubscribe
============================

If you would like to subscribe to the Procmail mailing list, send a
message containing the word "subscribe" (without the quotes (and
without this parenthetical remark, too :^)) in the Subject: field to
<procmail-request@informatik.rwth-aachen.de>. Please spend an
additional second to check the spelling of that single word before you
send off the message.
  To unsubscribe from the list, change "subscribe" to "unsubscribe".
This word seems even harder to spell right than the other one.
  Note that these messages should not be sent to the list address
<procmail@informatik> which is what you might have in your address
book or similar -- mail to that address will be distributed to all the
list subscribers (and make some of them very upset, if it's not about
Procmail.)

There is also a SmartList list and various special lists related to
Procmail and SmartList. There is a web page with detailed information
at <http://www.iki.fi/era/procmail/lists.html> and mirrors.

The FAQ contains some friendly comments on netiquette. Please read
them before posting to the list.

The list robot is not very tolerant of mail errors and will
automatically unsubscribe you if it gets many bounces from your
address. Just subscribe yourself again if this happens. (You should
expect to see several message from the list per day.)

I have no influence over how the list is operated. 

If you thought these instructions were too complicated, the
Unsubscribe FAQ is definitely not for you. (See URL above.)
