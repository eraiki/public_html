Hmm, looks like you've lost the envelope recipient.  Let's see if
that's what you're looking for:

Sure enough, you've lost the envelope recipient and now you're
wondering how to get it back.  The answer is that you cannot do so from
inside procmail.  You need to change your sendmail config, period.  A
correct "virtual domain" setup will have a .mc file (for sendmail's m4
config process) that contains lines like:

FEATURE(mailertable)		# possibly with a second arg
MAILER(procmail)


with a mailertable entry that looks like:

virtualdomain.com	procmail:/path/to/procmailrc/here


Then in the procmailrc /path/to/procmailrc/here you would put:


SENDER = $1
RECIPT = $2

:0
* RECIPT ?? ^someuser@
! -f $SENDER username@pop2.mailhost.com


etc.

DO NOT THINK YOU CAN DO THIS WITHOUT ALTERING YOUR SENDMAIL CONFIG.
You noticed how the Received: line will sometimes say "for <users...>".
Don't bother trying to match on that, as it doesn't work in at least
two cases (resent mail, and multiple recipients).  Do it right, or
don't bother doing it all.

You should also consider taking a look at the archives of this list, as
the discussion about this has been rehashed twice this month already.

Assuming you want to match against the destination headers, then yes,
you should just say:

:0
* ^TOsome-address
...


If that looks confusion you can stick some parens in to break it up
visually:

* (^TO)some-address
* ^TO(some-address)
* ^TO()some-address

Those should all work the exact same.

PS. I'm sorry if I seem overly harsh in the above.  It's just that this
comes up fairly regularly, and it seems that about half the time they
refuse to accept the answer.  <sigh>  It's just frustrating...
