<p>
This is a short presentation
of Procmail.
It is intended for
use as a handout
in conjunction with a
performance of some sort
(preferrably with a
screen projector
and a nice Unix prompt)
but you may not
enjoy it less
without the
performance<nobr> ...</nobr>
<p>
Prerequisites:
A little bit of
shell programming
and a willingness
to experiment.
<p>
This is strictly
from an end-user
perspective;
mail administration
on a system-wide scale
is totally outside
the scope of this
presentation.
<h2>
What is Procmail?
</h2>
<p>
Procmail is a tool
for processing mail.
It can be used to
dispatch your mail
or run a script
on incoming messages
which match a certain
pattern.
Most frequently
it's probably used
for rejecting spam
and setting up
various autoresponders.
But it's an extremely
versatile tool
which isn't even
restricted to use
with mail
(although you have to have
a taste for the curious
to really appreciate
the other possibilities).
<p>
The orientation
of this presentation
is to give an overview,
with glances at some
of the more powerful
features of Procmail.
Pointers to
self-study material
will be given
along the way.

Starting points -- questions
</a></h2>
<blockquote>
Alcohol is the answer,
but I can't remember
the question
</blockquote>
<p>
If you're just curious,
here are some questions
which could be answered
with "Procmail".
If you never ask yourself
these types of questions,
perhaps Procmail is not
for you.
<ul>
<li>
How can I keep mailing lists separate from my other mail?
<li>
How can I keep out messages from a certain person?
<li>
How can I send people a certain message automatically
if they mail me with a particular Subject line?
<li>
I get these automatically generated messages
which are in an inconvenient format, can they be fixed?
<li>
I get a lot of mail and some of it is always urgent,
can I make it come out on top when I open my mail program?
<li>
I get a lot of mail but some of it is not really meant for me.
Can I automatically pass it on to my assistant?
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="start-answers">
Starting points -- answers (maybe)
</a></h2>
<p>
Procmail might be the answer if
<ul>
<li>
you read your mail in Unix,
or at least have an idea how to
handle mail in Unix
<li>
or, you are a PC user but can have
your mail sent via a Unix account
<li>
you are somewhat comfortable
with shell scripts and/or Perl
<li>
you have a basic understanding
of mail headers, or are willing
to learn
</ul>
<p>
Certainly some canned solutions
are available, so if your needs
are simple and straightforward,
you can probably just copy
somebody's existing Procmail files
and take it from there.
<p>
If something goes wrong,
you probably need to understand
something about files and
the Unix file permission system,
as well as be able to ask
your system administrator
moderately intelligent questions.
<h2>
<a name="terminology-procmail">
Procmail terminology: Sorting, filtering, forwarding
</a></h2>
<p>
To return to our questions above,
here's how Procmail can help you
with the problems they were about.
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
How can I keep mailing lists separate from my other mail?
<li>
<dl>
<dt>
I get a lot of mail and some of it is always urgent,
can I make it come out on top when I open my mail program?
<dd>
<strong>Mail sorting</strong>
means saving mail to different <em>folders</em>
depending on e.g. the Subject line
or the author of each message.
<dd>
This means you can divert
mailing lists to low-priority folders
which you will read when you have the time,
and allow only important messages
into your regular inbox.
</dl>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>
How can I keep out messages from a certain person?
<dd>
This is really just a special case of sorting.
Sort them to a <em>very</em> low-priority folder,
such as <code>/dev/null</code>
</dl>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>
Procmail terminology (continued)
</h2>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>
I get these automatically generated messages
which are in an inconvenient format, can they be fixed?
<dd>
Procmail allows you to run
a regular Unix <strong>filter</strong>
on any message,
again depending on the
Subject, author, recipient,
priority, or message contents
if that's what you want.
<dd>
(Filters are programs
such as <code>tr</code> or <code>sort</code>
-- although those are not very meaningful
examples in this context.)
<dd>
Obviously, if your needs are special,
you will need to be able to
write the actual filter yourself.
Frequently a simple Perl or sed script
is all it takes, though.
</dl>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>
How can I send people a certain message automatically
if they mail me with a particular Subject line?
<dd>
<strong>Autoresponders</strong>
are essentially just a special sort
of filtering.
</dl>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>
I get a lot of mail but some of it is not really meant for me.
Can I automatically pass it on to my assistant?
<dd>
<strong>Forwarding</strong>
is again basically another sort of
filter -- a filter which sends on 
the mail to a new address.
Actually Procmail has some nice
built-in functions
which make this particularly
easy and elegant.
</dl>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="terminology-mail">
Mail terminology: MTA / MDA / MUA
</a></h2>
<p>
It's beneficial to understand
how Procmail fits into a larger picture
before we look at how to do things
in practice.
<p>
Here's a standard reference model
of a mail system. It has three
fairly independent components:
<blockquote><pre>
` , ` , ` , ` |  Remote MTA  |, ` , ` , ` , ` , ` ,
` , ` , ` , ` +--------------+, ` , ` , ` , ` , ` ,
` , ` , ` , ` , ` , ||  ` , ` , ` , ` , ` , ` , ` ,
` , ` , Internet` ,\  / ` , ` , ` , ` , ` , ` , ` ,
` , ` , ` , ` , ` , \/  ` , ` , ` , ` , ` , ` , ` ,
` , ` , ` , ` +--------------+, ` , ` , ` , ` , ` ,
--------------|     MTA      |----------------------
              +--------------+
               ||          ||
               \/          \/               +-----+
             +-----+     +-----+            | MUA |&#60;----- user
             | MDA |     | MDA |            +-----+
             +-----+     +-----+               ^
	        |           |                  |
mailbox file &#60;--+           +--&#62; other types of delivery? (IMAP?)
</pre></blockquote>
These are the <strong>Mail Transport Agent</strong>,
the <strong>Mail Delivery Agent</strong>,
and the <strong>Mail User Agent</strong>.
Each one of these has a distinct role.
<h2>
Mail terminology (continued)
</h2>
<p>
Here's a brief discussion of the acronyms
on the previous slide:
<dl>
<dt>
Mail Transport Agent (MTA)
<em>Sendmail, ZMailer, Qmail, Postfix</em>
<dd>
This program is responsible
for keeping track of how to
move mail across the Internet
and to other networks
(X.500, BITNET, etc).
<dt>
Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)
<em>(Sendmail), Filter, Procmail;
<code>deliver(8)</code></em>
<dd>
This program receives mail
from the MTA and from local users
and takes care of storing it
where the recipient wants it.
<dt>
Mail User Agent (MUA)
<em>Pine, Elm, Mutt; Netscape; MH; Emacs RMAIL, Gnus;
<code>mailx(1)</code></em>
<dd>
A user interface to the mail system,
used for reading, writing, and
manipulating mail interactively.
</dl>
<p>
The standard model has a few more elements
which are however less central to this discussion.
The
<a href="http://zmailer.org/zman/ztut-intro.html">Zmailer docs</a>
have a more complete picture
as well as a broader discussion.
<p>
A corollary to this picture
is that Procmail is basically
useful only for processing <strong>incoming</strong> mail,
although if your outgoing mail processing
has hooks to invoke a script on outgoing mail,
Procmail will work perfectly for that as well.
But such hooks are not standard in mainstream
mail systems today.
<p>
(A note for the curious:
Sendmail is properly a MTA
but it has built-in delivery functions
and you can use it from the command line
to send mail, so it's even a
primitive MUA.)
<h2>
<a name="invoking">
Invoking Procmail
</a></h2>
<p>
In practice, Procmail
is rarely invoked from
the Unix prompt,
except for testing
your Procmail settings.
By its nature,
it's an autonomous program
which is intended to be run
by your MTA
<nobr>(Sendmail, Qmail, ...)</nobr>
each time you receive
a new mail message.
Procmail is then responsible
for <em>delivering</em>
the message.
Its power comes from
the large flexibility
it offers over
regular MDAs,
which typically
only handle simple
delivery to a
given file
(<code>/var/spool/mail/era</code>
or an IMAP folder somewhere
or something like that).
<p>
With Sendmail,
Procmail can be installed
as everybody's MDA
(site-wide installation)
but if that's not the case,
Sendmail lets each user
run arbitrary delivery scripts
via the <code>$HOME/.forward</code> file.
<p>
The "standard" <code>.forward</code> file
for invoking Procmail
is fairly complicated,
but people often just copy and paste it
from the manual page.
Remember to change the last part
to your own login name!
<p>
(The manual page is different
on different sites,
but the usual variations
are explained in
<a href="http://www.iki.fi/era/procmail/mini-faq.html#forward">http://www.iki.fi/era/procmail/mini-faq.html#forward</a>
in some [too much?] detail.)
<h2>
Invoking Procmail (continued)
</h2>
<p>
Regardless of how exactly Procmail is invoked,
it goes through something like the following:
<ul>
<li>
Execute recipes in <code>/etc/procmailrc</code>
<li>
Execute recipes in <code>$HOME/.procmailrc</code>
<li>
If mail is still undelivered, deliver to <code>DEFAULT</code>
(usually something like <code>/var/spool/mail/era</code>)
</ul>
If you have no recipe files,
it should work exactly as
if Procmail wasn't there.
<p>
(This also means that you can figure out
whether or not you need a <code>.forward</code>:
If strange things start happening
when you create <code>$HOME/.procmailrc</code>,
Procmail is already being invoked
without your knowledge.)
<p>
Note that both Sendmail and Procmail
are quite easily offended
when it comes to who is allowed
to read and write these files.
As a rule, you should always
take care that your home directory
and your dot files are not
writable by anybody else.
(Whether you make them readable
is up to you.
Sendmail usually runs under
your own user ID
by the time it reads
any dot files of yours,
so these files should not need
to be world-readable.)
<h2>
<a name="mail-anatomy">
Anatomy of a mail message
</a></h2>
<p>
Before we can start tackling
mail handling, we also need to
talk about
the parts of a mail message.
These are what
Procmail fundamentally
works with
to decide how to deliver
a message,
guided by the rules you write.
<p>
A mail message is divided
into <strong>headers</strong>
and <strong>body</strong>.
The headers contain
address and route information
and the Subject line.
The body is the actual
text of the message.
<p>
The body is completely
free-form,
while the headers are
fairly rigid.
Each header consists
of a keyword (possibly
several tokens with
hyphens between them)
followed by a colon,
and then the value
of the field.
If the value is long,
it may be split over
many lines
so that each continued line
starts with a
space or tab character.
<p>
(There's a single
empty line after the header,
with no space or tab on it,
which separates the header
from the body;
this is occasionally called
the <strong>neck</strong>.)
<h2>
Anatomy of a mail message (continued)
</h2>
<p>
Here's a minimal example message:
<blockquote><pre>
	From era  Fri Jul 14 09:29:20 2000
	Received: from schildt.ling.helsinki.fi by stoker.lingsoft.fi
	Received: from localhost by schildt.ling.helsinki.fi
	<strong>From: era eriksson &#60;era@iki.fi&#62;</strong>
	<strong>To: era eriksson &#60;reriksso@lingsoft.fi&#62;</strong>
	<strong>Subject: Finally something even you can understand!</strong>
	Date: Thu, 13 Jul 2000 20:42:12 +0300 (EET DST)
	Message-Id: &#60;moomania-03945@schildt.ling.helsinki.fi&#62;

	Moo.

	The interesting headers appear highlighted.
</pre></blockquote>
Many MUA:s will hide away a lot of the headers,
because many of them are extremely uninteresting
unless you try to debug the mail system itself.
<p>
The very first line, the "From" without a colon,
isn't part of the headers really.
It's a separator string
which marks the beginning of a new message
in this particular file storage format.
This is stored as a "Berkeley" or "mbox" message,
which is probably the most widespread
format in use today.
(If you have your mail in <code>/var/spool/mail/you</code>
it's probably in Berkeley format.)
<h2>
Anatomy of a mail message (continued)
</h2>
<p>
Note that the order of headers is by and large
insignificant.
From, To, and Subject can occur in any order,
and there may be other headers in between.
<p>
Incidentally, Procmail does not
make any particular assumptions
about the contents of the headers
(and neither should your recipes
make such assumptions, hopefully).
In other words, Procmail doesn't care
if the headers contain 8-bit (or 16-bit or 32-bit)
data -- in violation of RFC822 --
nor does it try to decode or canonicalize
or otherwise modify input data
in any way
(though you can certainly implement
recipes to achieve such canonicalizations
if you want them).
Similarly, MIME headers and data
are fundamentelly just ASCII,
and you can write regular expressions
to identify the "magical" MIME stuff
just as well as any other predictably
formatted strings.
(However, MIME is a complex beast,
and covering all possible variants
of how MIME may validly encode
the same message in different ways
is more frustration than fun.)
<h2>
<a name="syntax">
Recipe syntax
</a></h2>
<p>
The rules for what to deliver where
are called <strong>recipes</strong>.
The syntax is vaguely related
to shell scripts in some ways,
but basically, the formalism
is completely unlike anything else.
It takes some getting used to,
but it's fairly succinct and
suprisingly simple to understand
once you get used to it.
<p>
In abstract terms,
each recipe has
a <em>mode</em>,
some <em>conditions</em> (optionally),
and an <em>action</em>.
<p>
If the conditions are left out,
the recipe is unconditional, obviously.
<p>
Recipes are read from top to bottom.
The first <strong>delivering recipe</strong>
terminates the delivery process
(unless you specify otherwise
with the mode flags).
<p>
Conditions are typically <strong>regular expressions</strong>,
although there are other interesting possibilities
as well.
<p>
Incidentally, if you have read this far
without losing interest,
but you don't know what a regular expression is,
you'd do well to read a basic Unix book.
It will tell you what you need to know
in order to get started with Procmail.
<h2>
Recipe syntax (continued)
</h2>
<p>
Here's a fairly standard
simple <code>.procmailrc</code> file.
<blockquote><pre>
	SHELL=/bin/sh   # Good habit to always have this
	MAILDIR=$HOME/Mail
	LOGFILE=$HOME/Mail/procmail.log

	:0:
	* ^Subject: test
	testing
</pre></blockquote>
The first three lines are variable assignments,
not recipes.
The following chunk of three lines
is a simple recipe.
<p>
The recipe has a condition,
which says that the action should be taken
only if the message being processed
has a header
matching the regular expression
<blockquote><pre>
	^Subject: test
</pre></blockquote>
The action is to save the message
to the mailbox file (or "folder")
<code>testing</code>.
This file doesn't have an absolute pathname,
so it will be created in the directory
named in the <code>MAILDIR</code> variable.
<h2>
Recipe syntax (continued)
</h2>
<p>
Here's that recipe again:
<blockquote><pre>
	:0:
	* ^Subject: test
	testing	
</pre></blockquote>
Notice the following details:
<ul>
<li>
The first line consists of
a colon, the number zero,
and a second colon.
<ul>
<li>
The first colon
signals the start of
a new recipe.
<li>
The meaning of the
number zero
is purely historical.
(Don't experiment --
only zero is useful.)
<li>
The second colon
means to use locking;
this should always be used
when saving to a file,
and virtually never
otherwise.
</ul>
<li>
The asterisk signals
the beginning of
a condition.
The condition
is a regular expression
which is matched
against the headers
of the message
being processed.
<li>
The action
has no special "signal"
character in front,
in this case;
saving to a folder
can be considered
the simplest form of
delivery,
so the syntax is simple,
too.
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="flags">
Flags
</a></h2>
<p>
The colon line
can carry a lot more
information
than just a single colon.
This is probably
the hardest part of
Procmail to learn
because the flags
are single-letter
options
-- sometimes with
no meaningful mnemonic
-- 
although they can
have a quite
significant impact
on what a recipe
actually does.
<p>
Here are some useful flags:
<dl>
<dt>
<code>B</code>
<dd>
Match against the body of the message
instead of the headers.
<dt>
<code>HB</code> or <code>BH</code>
<dd>
Match against both the headers
and the body.
<dt>
<code>D</code>
<dd>
Case is significant
when matching.
(Default is don't care.
Mail headers can be mixed case
according to RFC822
so normally you shoot yourself in the foot
if you treat case as significant.)
<dt>
<code>c</code>
<dd>
Clone:
Even if this recipe
is a <em>delivering</em> one,
continue processing
as if the message was still
undelivered.
<dd>
This is the key to
doing more than one thing
to a message.
<dt>
<code>f</code>
<dd>
Modify ("filter")
the message and continue
processing with the modified version.
(This is "filtering" because you can run
filtering pipelines like <code>tr A-Z a-z</code>
to turn all text into lowercase, for example.)
This obviously cannot be a delivering recipe.
</dl>
Note that some of these are uppercase while others are lowercase.
The <code>b</code> flag does something else than the <code>B</code> flag.
<p>
You get a brief listing of all the flags with <code>procmail -h</code>
at the Unix prompt.
<h2>
Flags (continued)
</h2>
<p>
Here's an example of a real-life recipe combo with a lot of flags:
<blockquote><pre>
	:0fhw   # Simplify headers by folding any continued lines back
	* ^[^ 	:]*:[ 	][ 	]|$[ 	]
	| formail -cz

	:0Ahcw: # If the previous recipe matched, save a copy of headers
	$HOME/headers.log

	# Processing continues here even though previous recipe "delivered"
	:0      # Pass this message on to Steve
	! steve@example.com
</pre></blockquote>
This also demonstrates the other two types of actions:
Feeding a message to an arbitrary shell command
(signalled by the pipe character <code>|</code>),
and forwarding a message to another address
(signalled by the exclamation mark <code>!</code>).
<p>
(Decoding the finer points is left as an
exercise<nobr><code> :-)</code></nobr>
<h2>
<a name="regex">
Regular expressions
</a></h2>
<p>
Procmail's regular expression support
is fairly good, although it's not
quite as supercharged as Perl's.
The closest related regex flavor
is probably Egrep's, although
Procmail has some interesting
features
(and some not so stunning quirks).
<p>
For a beginner, the important thing
is to realize that the condition
has to match exactly.
If you write
<blockquote><pre>
	* ^From: fred flinthe
</pre></blockquote>
then this condition will not match
if there are two spaces
after the colon, or if Fred
changes his email program's setup
so that it reads "Fred F. Flinthe"
in the From: field instead,
or if the header had been
<blockquote><pre>
	From: fredf@stonera.example.net (Fred Flinthe)
</pre></blockquote>
all along.
<p>
(And don't forget the leading
star which signals the start
of a condition.
That would produce some
hilarious / hysterical
mystery errors
which can be very hard
to figure out.)
<h2>
Regular expressions (continued)
</h2>
<p>
The other source of newbie confusion
comes from not realizing that <code>.*</code> (dot star)
is the "match anything" wildcard in regex-ese (not just star,
and not whatever else that happens to work in INTERCAL or
Visual Basic or JavaScript).
<p>
... And/or not realizing that <code>*</code>
and <code>.</code> (full stop) and <code>[</code>
and <code>]</code> and <code>(</code> and <code>)</code>
and <code>?</code> and all their friends
have a special "magical" meaning in regex-ese.
So if you want to
match any of them literally,
you need to put a backslash
in front.
<p>
The next step after you've learned the absolute basics
-- for some users, at least --
is the hypercorrectness stage,
where you backslash everything
which "looks magical"
just to be on the safe side.
This is dangerous, too,
at least if taken to extremes.
<h2>
<a name="regex-peculiarities">
Procmail regex peculiarities
</a></h2>
<p>
The only really unusual things
in Procmail's regex support
are the <code>\&#60;</code>
and <code>\&#62;</code>
"word boundary" operators,
which are actually just a
shorthand for a character
class;
the predefined macros
<code>^TO&#95;</code> and
<code>^FROM&#95;MAILER</code>
and <code>^FROM&#95;DAEMON</code>;
and
the weird <code>\/</code> grab
operator (highly magical
-- pity we don't have
real backrefs, though).
<p>
Another slightly unusual,
but highly convenient
feature --
which you will find is
quite natural
if you're used to working
with regular expressions
-- is the behavior of the
<code>$</code> and <code>^</code>
line anchors: they actually
match a literal newline
if you use them anywhere
inside a regular expression.
<p>
Finally,
there is also a <code>^^</code>
anchor which is similar to
Perl's "beginning/end of search space"
operator, which matches on the
beginning/end of the header,
or body, or whatever you are
matching on.
(You can match on the values
of variables, too.)
<p>
That's right, you can match
multi-line values
with a single regular expression.
Here's an example which adds a
Secret Subliminal Header
to messages with a lot of empty lines
(i.e. adjacent newlines)
right at the top of the body
(only incoming messages,
fortunately).
<blockquote><pre>
	:0Bfhw     # Look for a lot of empty lines at the top of the body
	* ^^$$$$$
        | formail -a "X-Plode: Poor Netscape luser, I pity you."
</pre></blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="deliveredness">
Deliveredness
</a></h2>
<p>
Another concept which is tricky to learn
is <strong>deliveredness</strong>.
This is a fundamental thing to understand
because it determines which recipes
will be activated when.
<blockquote>
The first successful
delivering recipe
will cause Procmail
to terminate.
</blockquote>
A delivering recipe is like <code>exit 0</code>
in a shell script -- it says "we're done".
If that's not what you want to say,
you need to know how to phrase your recipe
differently.
<p>
A recipe with a <code>c</code> flag
is never delivering.
(Or actually, it will cause Procmail
to fork; one copy of Procmail
continues processing
almost as if the recipe with the
<code>c</code> flag hadn't been there.
So if you add a <code>c</code> flag
to a recipe which wasn't delivering
in the first place, you will have
two copies of the same message!)
<p>
Other than that, any recipe
which forwards or stores the message
is delivering. Anything else
is by definition not delivering;
variable assignments,
filtering actions
(recipes with an <code>f</code> flag),
unsuccessful delivery attempts
(permission denied, syntax error),
recipes whose conditions don't match
-- these are not delivering actions,
so Procmail will continue processing
with the next recipe until it
reaches end of file.
<p>
(Remember, Procmail finally
delivers to whatever
the <code>DEFAULT</code> variable
is set to if it "falls off"
the end of the <code>.procmailrc</code>
file.)

<a name="answers">
Questions revisited, with answers
</a></h2>
<p>
Here are again those questions we had at the beginning.
<ul>
<li>
How can I keep mailing lists separate from my other mail?
<li>
<dl>
<dt>
I get a lot of mail and some of it is always urgent,
can I make it come out on top when I open my mail program?
<dd>
If you can find a regular expression
(or other condition)
which uniquely identifies the mail
you want to divert,
nothing could be easier.
<blockquote><pre>
	:0:
	* ^From owner-kt-info@listserv\.funet\.fi
	kt-info

	:0:  # two conditions: both must be met
	* ^From th?orvalds@transmeta\.com
	* ^Subject:.*transmeta visit
	URGENT.linus
	# (of course it's "torvalds", but don't tell the spammers)
</pre></blockquote>
<dd>
The <code>From&nbsp;</code> pseudoheader
is often fairly reliable for this sort
of thing; mailing lists frequently also add
a <code>List-Info:</code> or similar header.
<dd>
Reliably detecting which messages
from regular correspondents
are more urgent than others
is a Strong AI challenge, of course.
But some people have developed
fairly elaborate rules of thumb
(look for certain keywords and phrases,
perhaps also depending on time of day
and day of week?)
which work remarkably well.
</dl>
</ul>
<h2>
Questions revisited (continued)
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>
How can I keep out messages from a certain person?
<dd>
In the brutal case,
deliver the message to Bit Heaven.
<blockquote><pre>
	:0
	* ^From aila\.anoppi@soneraplaza\.fi
	/dev/null
</pre></blockquote>
<dd>
Letting people know
you are ignoring them systematically
is not usually polite,
and if you have a serious problem,
you should probably revert to
social engineering (calling their boss,
or whatever).
<dd>
<code>/dev/null</code>
is a very blunt solution
and very often not the Right Thing.
But for killing off a flood
of spew from a looping
mail relay, it's a good tool.
</dl>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>
I get a lot of mail but some of it is not really meant for me.
Can I automatically pass it on to my assistant?
<dd>
Given the right
regular expression
(or other condition
to identify those messages),
it's trivial.
<blockquote><pre>
	:0c   # Copy to secretary
	* ^From.*@microsoft\.com
	* ^Subject:.*handoff
	! secretary

	:0:   # Store in a Safe Place. Clean out before Christmas
	forwarded.ms
</pre></blockquote>
</dl>
</ul>
<h2>
Questions revisited (continued)
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>
How can I send people a certain message automatically
if they mail me with a particular Subject line?
<dd>
The <code>procmailex</code> manual page
has an assortment of autoresponder
examples, including a souped-up
<code>vacation(1)</code> clone
and a simple ftp-by-mail server.
</dl>
<li>
<dl>
<dt>
I get these automatically generated messages
which are in an inconvenient format, can they be fixed?
<dd>
Again,
given a regular expression
which matches only those messages,
and a simple shell script which
cleans them up,
this is trivial.
Of course,
finding a good regular expression
and writing the script
can be challenging.
(But then it's not really
a Procmail problem anymore.)
<dd>
Here's an old favorite:
<blockquote><pre>
	:0BDbfw  # remove that #&$@! annoying Yahoo footer
	* ^Do You Yahoo!\?$
	| sed -e 's/^--$/,$d'  # bug: trims starting from the FIRST "--"
</pre></blockquote>
<dd>
Similarly simple recipes
should be easy to find
for most of these "branded"
types of email messages
-- Hotmail, NetMinder,
Microsoft Outkook HTML attachments
(challenging!)
</dl>
</ul>
<h2>
<a name="pitfalls">
Common pitfalls
</a></h2>
<p>
Here's some distilled wisdom for you.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.iki.fi/era/mail/autoresponder-faq.html">Annoying autoresponders </a>
are a real pain in the 944A2.
Think twice before you roll your own.
<li>
There is
around half a dozen
manual pages.
Make sure you've found
them <nobr>all ...</nobr>
<li>
Don't waste your time on spam recipes.
Get your system administrator
to implement a site-wide shield.
If you need personal protection,
there's a zillion packages
of Procmail recipes you can
"plug and play". Don't waste time
writing your own antispam recipes.
Better yet,
<a href="http://www.iki.fi/era/spam/faq/">don't let the spammers find you in the first place.</a>
<li>
Procmail is paranoid about
permissions. If your home directory
is group writable, Procmail will
simply refuse to deliver any mail.
(This is a compile-time option;
read the comments in <code>config.h</code>
and act accordingly.)
<li>
Procmail is
<code>&#60;strong&#62;&#60;large&#62;&#60;blink&#62;</code>
NOT
<code>&#60;/blink&#62;&#60;/large&#62;&#60;/strong&#62;</code>
a mail transport agent.
If your ISP delivers all the mail
for your private little domain
into a large mailbox
and you are trying to split it
back into mom's mail and pop's mail
and your own mail and your dog's mail,
There Will Be Grief.
Just find a better ISP.
<li>
Procmail handles a single message at a time.
If you have an mbox of messages
and you want to process each one,
you process each one separately.
Here's how:
<blockquote><pre>
unix$ <strong>formail -s procmail &#60;large.mbox</strong>
</pre></blockquote>
See the manual for the <code>formail</code>
companion utility for some other nifty tricks.
It's a very useful mail manipulation tool
in its own right.

There's a lot of material about Procmail
out there
but it's not very cohesive.

The one single resource you should be aware of
if you intend to get serious about Procmail
is the mailing list.

There's been talk of
an O'Reilly book
about Procmail
from time to time
but it just never
seems to materialize.
<p>
(Quite frankly,
even I sent them
a manuscript proposal
once.
They just sneered
at <nobr>me. <code>:-)</code></nobr>
