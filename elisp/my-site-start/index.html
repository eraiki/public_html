<h1>WARNING: Going Away</h1>
<p>
There is still a Darcs repository here if you know how to access it,
but it is no longer being maintained.</p>
<p>
Please update your bookmarks to point to
<a href="http://github.com/tripleee/my-site-start/">
github.com/tripleee/my-site-start</a> instead.
Thanks.</p>
