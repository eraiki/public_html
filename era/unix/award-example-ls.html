<h1>An example of dealing with file names with spaces in them</h1>
<p>
This example won't make much sense unless you're coming from the
<a href="award.html#ls">Useless Use of Cat Award Page</a>
<blockquote><pre>
	$ <b># Create file names with spaces in them</b>
	$ <b>touch "moo bar"</b>
	$ <b>touch "foo bar baz"</b>
	$ <b>ls -1 *</b>
	foo bar baz 
	moo bar
	$ <b># Try to list them in a for loop</b>
	$ <b>for f in *; do ls $f; done</b>
	ls: foo: No such file or directory
	ls: bar: No such file or directory
	ls: baz: No such file or directory
	ls: moo: No such file or directory
	ls: bar: No such file or directory
	$ <b># Okay, try with double quotes around $f instead</b>
	$ <b>for f in *; do ls "$f"; done</b>
	foo bar baz
	moo bar
	$ <b># Now demonstrate the bad impact of the backticks</b>
	$ <b>for f in `echo *`; do ls $f; done</b>
	ls: foo: No such file or directory
	ls: bar: No such file or directory
	ls: moo: No such file or directory
	ls: bar: No such file or directory
	ls: baz: No such file or directory
	$ <b># Even the double quotes don't help anymore:</b>
	$ <b>for f in `echo *`; do ls "$f"; done</b>
	ls: foo: No such file or directory
	ls: bar: No such file or directory
	ls: moo: No such file or directory
	ls: bar: No such file or directory
	ls: baz: No such file or directory
	$ <b># Getting desperate sure doesn't help any either:</b>
	$ <b>for f in "`echo *`"; do ls "$f"; done</b>
	ls: foo bar baz moo bar: No such file or directory
</pre></blockquote>
(Tip: Create a temporary directory under <code>/tmp</code> for small
experiments like this. Remember to clean up after yourself when you're
done.)
