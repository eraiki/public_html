making sure their Procmail recipes work as intended <i>before</i>
you put them in your real <code>.procmailrc</code> file.
<p>
There are also some thoughts for when you have trouble with

<a name="remarks">
Opening Remarks
</a></h2>
All too often, you get bounces from people who put together a quick
and dirty Procmail recipe and never got around to verifying that it
worked right. (I've been guilty of this myself, a number of times.
It's just too easy to forget to test things that are "easy".)
<p>
Besides the obvious wish to avoid snafus with your mail -- whether 
those include embarrassing bounces to the senders or not -- there are
a number of additional reasons you might want to play around with
Procmail. For one thing, when you can fool around without the risk
of losing mail, it's much easier and safer to really try to learn how the
program works. Until I got some experience with debugging Procmail recipes, 
I was too chicken to even try out -- much less learn -- any of the 
advanced constructs.
<p>
An often cited maxim is RTFM. I'd like to coin another principle which
I think is just as important: <i>Try It And See What Happens.</i> 
This is of course <strong>not</strong> to be construed as 
"put some crufty hack in your production <code>.procmailrc</code> 
and see if you lose any mail".&nbsp;<code>:-)</code>
<h2>
<a name="framework">
A Framework
</a></h2>
First of all, it's probably a good idea to keep a skeletal
<code>.procmailrc</code> file around. There's not much you can put
in there by default but on the other hand, if you really just want to
try something quick and dirty, you'll probably be too lazy to put in
the obligatory 
<code>SHELL=/bin/sh DEFAULT=/tmp/$LOGNAME</code> yada yada
and thus end up shooting yourself in the foot one way or another 
more often than you'd like.
<p>
The
<a href="http://www.iki.fi/era/procmail/mini-faq.html">(not so mini) FAQ</a>
comes with a skeletal
<a href="http://www.iki.fi/era/procmail/experiments.rc">experiments.rc</a>
which should do as a starting point. It's something I cooked up for
the FAQ and so I wanted to keep it clean and simple. Needless to say,
my own "skeletal" <code>.procmailrc</code> is not exactly clean and simple
-- I tend to leave in my old experiments just in case I'd like to pick up
on them again later
(and thus I end up shooting myself in the foot one way or another
more often than I like&nbsp;<code>:-)</code>
<p>
Here are some highlights from mine:
<blockquote><pre>
	SHELL=/bin/sh           # always always always always always always
	MAILDIR=$HOME/scratch   # this is a symlink to a scratch disk
	DEFAULT=$HOME/scratch/prc.out
	VERBOSE=${VERBOSE:-yeah}
</pre></blockquote>
That last one is important; it lets me pass in <code>VERBOSE=no</code>
on the command line if I want to override it. This is a useful construct
for a lot of things -- actually the <code>LOGFILE</code> setting in my
real files follows this convention (so I can debug a module on its own
and get logging somewhere else than in my regular <code>procmail.log</code>
if I run it with <code>LOGFILE</code> unset. In other words, 
<code>LOGFILE</code> normally gets set in my top <code>.procmailrc</code>,
obviously, and the module will not override it, but if I start up the
module on its own, it will redirect logging elsewhere.)
<p>
The first line is also important. Procmail's inability to interact with
some csh:s and tcsh:s is probably the biggest source of frustrating and
"inexplicable" Procmail problems. (It's still not clear to me why this
happens, or why Procmail is not compiled by default to always use
<code>/bin/sh</code> unless specifically instructed otherwise.)

(1979)
<!-- This FreeBSD HTML copy is horribly malformatted [all centered! Yes!] -->
</dl>
<h3>
<a name="logging">
Learn to Use the Log
</a></h3>
<p>
It is useful to be able to see what Procmail is doing at various stages
of processing. The fundamental tool for this is the log file, although
for interactive tests, it's usually nicer to not set <code>LOGFILE</code>
to anything, in which case any logging will be sent to standard error.
<p>
Obviously, you will need some familiarity with what goes in the log
so you can decode it. The normal <code>LOGABSTRACT</code> fields are 
explained in the manual, and most of the rest (what you get with
<code>VERBOSE</code> logging) should be fairly easy to understand.
<p>
Here are some things which are not so self-evident:
<ul>
<li>
With <code>VERBOSE</code> logging, you get to see when a
shell is spawned and when it's not. This is because Procmail
formats the "executing ..." log entry differently depending
on how it's executing a program. If a shell is being invoked,
the entire command line is displayed as one long string,
verbatim. When Procmail is doing the <code>exec</code> itself,
it puts commas between the arguments (so you can see how it
parsed them).
<li>
There will be a time stamp with Procmail's process-id written
to the log once a second, so you can see how time passes.
</ul>
Very often, your own little <code>LOG=</code> messages can be the
most useful part of the log file. Don't be afraid to log too much --
you never know when you are going to need to see what exactly is
going on. 
<p>
On the other hand, most logging should probably be enabled only 
when you are debugging.
You could of course use <code>LOG={VERBOSE:+"Message"}</code>
but I find this cumbersome to type in (and it's probably also a
slight waste of resources when you're not debugging) --
I just take care to format my code so that I can enable my diagnostic
logging messages with a trivial search-and-replace operation
(i.e. always use a particular spacing pattern before the
<code>LOG=</code> assignments so I can replace those with
<code>#LOG=</code> and vice versa. Commenting and uncommenting like
this doesn't work all that trivially if you have multi-line log strings,
obviously). 
<p>
Tangentially, you should also pay attention to your
<a href="#system-log">system's log files.</a>
<h3>
<a name="envdump">
Getting Information About Procmail's Environment
</a></h3>
<p>
Don't forget that Procmail actually gives you the opportunity to
run basically any command on the host where the mail is being processed.
That means you can make it e.g. identify itself. Here's one thing that is
easy to rig and use:
<blockquote><pre>
	:0
        * ^Subject: envdump please$
	{
	    LOG="envdump: uname -a
`uname -a`
envdump: ls -l / /var /var/spool /var/spool/mail /var/spool/mail/$LOGNAME
`ls -l / /var /var/spool /var/spool/mail /var/spool/mail/$LOGNAME`
envdump: ls -l /usr/local/bin/procmail
`ls -l /usr/local/bin/procmail`
envdump: (done)
"
	    :0
	    /dev/null
	}
</pre></blockquote>
You should probably use a different Subject: line
(otherwise others who have read this page can fool around with your server).
Clearly, anything that you are wondering about which can be found
out by some sort of Unix command line can be included in this recipe.
Output goes to the log file as usual.
<p>
Just to make the obvious explicit, you'd trigger this by sending yourself
a test message which matches the Subject: regular expression.
<h3>
<a name="tmpfile">
Saving Data to a Temporary File
</a></h3>
<p>
Another useful trick you are going to need is saving the message
you're dealing with in a temporary file, so you can examine what
was there at some point during Procmail's execution. This is usually
no more complicated than
<blockquote><pre>
	:0c
	/tmp/tmpdir/.
</pre></blockquote>
where <code>/tmp/tmpdir</code> is a directory you have made sure
exists and is writable. (You can append to an mbox file, too, of course,
or use any other folder format you find convenient. In practice,
I end up writing to mbox files most of the time, although having
individual messages as separate files in a directory makes some things
simpler.)
<p>
In more involved cases, <code>tee</code> is your friend. To see
what exactly goes into a Sendmail invocation you are having problems
with, try something like
<blockquote><pre>
	:0
	* conditions, probably (including loop checking)
	| ( whatever ) \
	  <b>| tee /tmp/tmpdir/$$ \</b>
	  | $SENDMAIL $SENDMAILFLAGS
</pre></blockquote>
(The expression <code>$$</code> expands to the process-id of your 
currently running Procmail. Use <code>tee -a</code> to append to
an existing file.)
<p>
If you're creating a lot of diagnostic files, it's good form
to remember to clean up after yourself. Your system administrator
might have set up a partition other than <code>/tmp</code> for
your temporary files (on many Unix systems, the <code>/tmp</code>
disk is rather small, and/or sacred for the use of the system
administration. Many places have a <code>/scratch</code> disk
for users' temporary file storage needs. This is usually not
backed up, and probably subject to disappear without notice if
one of the "real" disks needs to be replaced or something).
<h3>
<a name="bcc-self">
Sending Yourself Diagnostic Messages
</a></h3>
<p>
If you are having trouble with a recipe which sends a response
of some sort, you could add an address of your own to the recipient
list. That means you will receive a copy of the outgoing message
(if indeed it's going out at all. Make sure to check it's not
stuck in the queue before you assume nothing is happening).
<p>
In order to better reflect reality, and also in order to
avoid creating mail loops, this should probably be a remote address
(perhaps Hotmail if you don't have any "real" addresses in other
domains, or a friend who doesn't mind receiving oodles of test
messages&nbsp;... a good way to find out who are <i>not</i> your <i>true</i>
friends).
<p>
If you are constructing your response message's headers on the
fly, and sending it off with <code>sendmail -t</code>, just add
a Cc: or Bcc: header with your debugging address.
<blockquote><pre>
	:0
	* some conditions, no doubt
	| ( formail -yada yada \
	        <b>-I "Bcc: deodorant-tester@hotmail.com" \</b>
		-and yaaada ) \
	  | $SENDMAIL $SENDMAILFLAGS -t
</pre></blockquote>
If you are explicitly naming the recipient(s) on Sendmail's
command line, you can just add more addresses.
<p>
On the other hand, if you aren't sure the message you are generating
is even syntactically valid, it's probably better to simply replace
the call to Sendmail with a save to a temporary file where you can
examine the generated response message. Remember, if you can send
it from the command line, it will probably work from within Procmail,
too (and vice versa. But see the <code>tee</code> trick in the
previous section if you want the best of both worlds).
<h3>
<a name="log-more">
Additional Logging
</a></h3>
<p>
(The subhead should perhaps read "Beyond Last Resort".&nbsp;<code>:-)</code>
<p>
If you suspect your Sendmail or your shell of being faulty, 
or just want to be really sure of what they are doing,
you can start messing around with their flags. 
<p>
I am willing to bet money that you are on the wrong track if you are
seriously considering this. I am also willing to bet that if you don't
have <code>SHELL=/bin/sh</code> right at the top of your 
<code>.procmailrc</code>, adding that will solve your problem.
<p>
To get a few lines in the log file for each command the shell
executes, add something like
<blockquote><pre>
	SHELLFLAGS=${SHELLFLAGS:--}vx
</pre></blockquote>
You can probably omit either <code>x</code> or <code>v</code>
-- see the manual page for your shell to find out what they do.
(The output is usually slightly unreadable but still decipherable.)
<p>
In the same vein, it might be useful to pass a <code>-v</code> flag
to Sendmail to see what it's up to. (See
<a href="#sendmail-v">below</a>
for what the results look like.)
<p>
Other programs you use might also have the capability to
produce optional extended information about what they are doing.
In your own scripts, this is always a good facility to provide.
<p>
In Perl, liberally sprinkle your code with
<code>warn "$0: reached checkpoint after init\n" if $debug;</code> --
in shell scripts, this is a little bit harder to do idiomatically.
Here's one approach:
<blockquote><pre>
	#!/bin/sh
	IFDEBUG=:
	case $1 in --debug) shift ; IFDEBUG= ; IFNODEBUG=: ;; esac
	# ... real option processing here
	$IFDEBUG	echo "$0: reached checkpoint after init" >&2
	# ...
</pre></blockquote>
I define <code>IFNODEBUG</code> as the complement of <code>IFDEBUG</code>
because I often find it useful (unlike in Perl scripts, but I guess
in the end it's not all that strange -- it's more important in shell
scripts to have things in a particular order, etc).
If you decide your script is sufficiently debugged at some point,
cleaning out the debugging stuff is again a matter of regex search and
replace. (Corollary to Murphy's law: This will break your script, or
ruin your day when you find that you need to put that stuff back in
somehow.)
<h1>
<a name="startup">
Getting Procmail to Run in the First Place
</a></h1>
This is not particularly something I wanted to write about, but here
are some quick tips if you seem to not be able to get Procmail to do
anything at all. If you think you know what you are doing, you will
probably want to go over this list more or less in reverse order.
<h3>
<a name="installed">
Is Procmail Installed Correctly?
</a></h3>
<p>
Can you run Procmail from the command line and not get a
core dump?
<blockquote><pre>
	$ <b>procmail -v</b>
</pre></blockquote>
If this works as expected, what happens if you actually
try to deliver a message?
<blockquote><pre>
	$ <b>procmail DEFAULT=/dev/null VERBOSE=yes /dev/null &#60;/dev/null</b>
</pre></blockquote>
This means: Run Procmail. The place to deliver mail to is
<code>/dev/null</code> unless the <code>rc</code> file says
otherwise. We want verbose logging (to standard error, as long
as <code>LOGFILE</code> doesn't get set to something) and
use <code>/dev/null</code> as the <code>rc</code> file
(i.e., effectively, just deliver to <code>DEFAULT</code>).
The message to deliver is standard input, which is
redirected to come from <code>/dev/null</code> as well.
<p>
Here are the results of a sample run:
<blockquote><pre>
	procmail: [8532] Thu Mar 25 15:08:16 1999
	procmail: Rcfile: "/dev/null"
	procmail: Assigning "MAILDIR=/home/era"
	procmail: Assigning "LASTFOLDER=/dev/null"
	procmail: Opening "/dev/null"
	  Folder: /dev/null							      0
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If this works as expected, are you sure the permissions on the
Procmail binary are such that e.g. Sendmail can run it?
(When called from your own private <code>.forward</code>,
Procmail only needs to have execute permissions set for yourself,
of course.)
<h3>
<a name="host">
Are Things Happening on the Host Where You Think They Should Happen?
</a></h3>
<p>
Many sites have a designated mail host which mounts users'
home directories over NFS or something, but which has completely
its own idea of what's in e.g. <code>/usr/local/bin</code> and
so if you installed Procmail on a different host, your problems
might simply boil down to this fact.
<p>
The FAQ has
<a href="http://www.iki.fi/era/procmail/mini-faq.html#appendix-mx">an appendix with more information on this.</a>
<p>
There is a nasty twist to watch out for:
In principle, the mail host could have mounted the user's home
directory under a different name than what the user sees in
interactive logins. Thus some absolute path names you try to
write to might not be valid on the mail host. See
<a href="#diagnostics">below.</a>
<h3>
<a name="invoking">
Do You Know How to Run Procmail in Your Setting?
</a></h3>
<p>
This means: If your site is not using Sendmail, do you know what
mechanism you should use to invoke Procmail?
<p>
If Procmail is installed as your MDA, you should be able to
use it simply by creating a <code>.procmailrc</code> file in
your home directory. If you are unsure of whether Procmail
is your MDA, this is easy enough to test: Create a minimal
<code>.procmailrc</code> with <code>LOGFILE</code> set, 
send yourself mail (perhaps from a Hotmail account or something)
and see if stuff appears in the log file you designated.
<p>
The
<a href="http://www.iki.fi/era/procmail/advanced"><code>advanced</code> document</a>
from the distribution contains some tips for installing Procmail
as your MDA but I am unaware of any good collection of tips
for forwarding using different MTA:s other than the only
indirectly relevant discussion in the
<a href="http://www.qz.to/~eli/faqs/addressing.html">Mail Addressing FAQ</a>
by Eli the Bearded, which contains some tips for MMDF and
Exim users (and Qmail, to a lesser extent).
<p>
For Sendmail and compatibles, if Procmail is not your MDA,
you will need to create a <code>.forward</code> file with
reasonably strict permissions. The manual page for Procmail
has instructions (they differ slightly depending on other
factors in your installation, which the Procmail installation
script figures out before it creates the manual pages).
<p>
The <code>.forward</code> file seems to be the mechanism of
choice in most other environments, too, although the syntax
of the file apparently varies with different MTA:s.
<h3>
<a name="diagnostics">
Is Procmail Doing What You Think it Should be Doing?
</a></h3>
<p>
If you can get Procmail to produce output somewhere (i.e. it runs
and you can write to the log or to some file in your home directory)
it's probably a good idea to put in some diagnostic tests in your
.rc file (perhaps you should install a testing <code>.procmailrc</code>
for now and put back the real <code>.procmailrc</code> you want to
use when you have sorted out your problems).
<p>
Some useful things to get into these diagnostics include
<ul>
<li>	the result of <code>uname -a</code>
<li>	an <code>ls -l</code> on Procmail itself and associated files
<li>	perhaps something like <code>df</code> to see what's mounted
and where
<li>	whatever else you think you are uncertain of or have
reasons to doubt, such as the contents of some of 
Procmail's built-in variables (what exactly was matched
by the regex you have problems with? Try adding an 
<code>\/</code> operator and examine what gets assigned 
to <code>MATCH</code> [but do note that MATCHing modifies
Procmail's longest-match behavior with certain 
regular expressions])
</ul>
<p>
See
<a href="#envdump">the remarks on logging on the first half of this page.</a>
<p>
A very confusing misfeature is Procmail's inability to cooperate with
csh-related shells. This is probably one of the most important reasons
for problems which are not trivial to diagnose. Before you do anything
else, put in <code>SHELL=/bin/sh</code> at the top of your
<code>.procmailrc</code> file. Actually you should get in the habit
of putting this at the start of all your Procmail scripts. As long
as your login shell is not a csh or tcsh, you probably won't even notice
the difference -- until you try to share your scripts with someone
less fortunate.
<h3>
<a name="system-log">
Do the system log files tell you anything?
</a></h3>
<p>
The first place to check, if you have the permissions, is your
system's log file. If you try to run Procmail and nothing happens,
some sort of logging information is virtually certain to get
written somewhere.
<p>
Unfortunately, not all admins feel comfortable leaving the log files
readable to mortal users.
<p>
Also unfortunately, the locations of various log files are not
very firmly standardized. Some places to look are <code>/var/log</code>
or <code>/var/adm</code> -- if you have permission to look there.
But the <b>syslog</b><i>(3)</i> interface documentation
and/or the <b>syslogd</b><i>(8)</i> manual page
should tell you what you need to know.
<p>
If Procmail doesn't have permission to do anything, it will spew
something to the system console. On modern systems, console log
messages will also be written to a file somewhere, typically something
like <code>/var/log/messages</code>.
<p>
Sendmail usually logs every message it tries to deliver, either to
its own log file (perhaps <code>/var/log/mail.log</code> or perhaps
even into the regular <code>/var/log/messages</code> file)
<p>
As with all log files, you should probably have a look at them sometime
just to get a feel for what's supposed to be there when the system is
working.
<h3>
<a name="chmod">
Check For Permission Problems
</a></h3>
<p>
The permissions of the <code>.procmailrc</code> file
need to be rather tight. <code>chmod 600 .procmailrc</code> is
probably not a bad idea before you proceed with testing.
<p>
The same applies to <code>.forward</code>, if you need one.
<p>
Procmail 3.13 will also check the permissions on your home
directory, and bail out if they are too lax (i.e. anybody who
can write there can overwrite your <code>.procmailrc</code>
with a sinister one).
<p>
(Incidentally, the most frequently asked question from Red Hat
users recently has been "how come Procmail stopped working
when I upgraded". Red Hat has group write permissions on
everything, which is okay because each user is in her own
group, but the guys who made the 3.13.1-1 RPM didn't bother
to tell Procmail when they compiled it. See the
<a href="../procmail/mini-faq.html#group-writable">FAQ</a>
for a bit more on this.)
<p>
It's also a good idea to check for write permission in various
other places; files which control what's supposed to happen
should generally be writable only by owner, and directories
where Procmail will need to write out logging information or
mail will obviously need to be writable.
<h3>
<a name="trace">
Desperation, Part II:
Can You Run Procmail Under a Debugger?
</a></h3>
<p>
Different Unix variants offer different tracing, debugging, and
profiling programs, but usually something like a call tracer is
available. (Not so under e.g. HP-UX, where the call tracing facility
is powerful enough to be a security hole, and so it is usually
made unavailable to mortal users.)
<p>
On Linux, look for <code>strace</code>.
On SunOS/Solaris, try <code>truss</code>.
On various BSD-derived systems, <code>trace</code> is probably
the thing you're looking for.
<p>
Whatever it's called, by running Procmail (or any other program)
via the call tracer, it executes as normal, but you also get a file
(perhaps on standard error or standard output) with all the system
calls made by the program you're tracing. That means, among other
things, that you get to see which files it attempts to open and
how and when it tries to allocate memory.
<p>
Like the headline suggests, this is for truly desperate situations
(but fooling around with the call tracer just to familiarize yourself
with the facility is probably time well spent).
<p>
If you are comfortable with a source debugger, compiling Procmail and
single-stepping through the code can be a great way to understand the
program.
<h3>
<a name="chat">
Can You Talk to the MTA?
</a></h3>
<p>
This might be too complicated for newbies, but nothing really
beats a direct telnet to the SMTP port on the mail host.
If you don't know the protocol, a brief overview of RFC821
might be in place here -- it's by no means complicated.
You want to understand <code>HELO</code>, <code>MAIL FROM</code>,
<code>RCPT TO</code>, <code>VRFY</code>, <code>EXPN</code>. and 
<code>QUIT</code>.
<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>telnet host.name.here 25</b>
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 host.name.here ESMTP Sendmail 8.8.5/8.8.0; Thu, 25 Mar 1999 16:29:52 +0200 (EET)

<p>
Of course, in this case, the host might simply have been configured
to not reveal anything about its local users, in order to foil
spammers and other abusers. You can try to actually type in a real
mail message and see what kind of response to get, but at that
point, it's probably already better to work with a couple of layers
of convenient wrapping between yourself and the raw SMTP connection.
<p>
Here's a session which worked out better:

Talk to the MTA Some More
</a></h3>
<p>
This is unfortunately specific to Sendmail and compatibles.
Tips for other MTA:s will be gratefully accepted.
<p>
To see whether the MTA is willing to accept mail for the user 
in question, you need to have shell access on the mailhost 
and run this there:
<blockquote><pre>
	$ <b>sendmail -bv username</b>
	username... deliverable: mailer local, user username
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If you get an answer mentioning a remote host name and so forth, 
it means you are on the wrong host, and need to figure out where 
the mail ultimately gets delivered.
<p>
<a name="sendmail-v">
To actually try to deliver something and watch while Sendmail
is doing it, try this:
</a><blockquote><pre>
	$ <b>sendmail -v username &#60;/dev/null</b>
	username... Connecting to local...
	username... Sent
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
If there is an error, sendmail will be delivering a bounce message
back to you using normal means.
<p>
Here is a more involved session, namely one involving a
<code>.forward</code> file:
<blockquote><pre>
	$ <b>sendmail -v era &#60;/dev/null</b>
	/home/era/.forward: line 1: forwarding to era@iki.fi
	era@iki.fi... Connecting to mail.iki.fi. via esmtp...
	era@iki.fi... Connecting to mail2.iki.fi. via esmtp...

(You should perhaps not try to deliver to a nonexistent user
just to see what it looks like, unless you are the postmaster
or know for a fact that the local postmaster will not also get
a copy of the needless bounce message. Signed, been there,
done that. Blush.)
<p>
There are numerous debugging options you can pass in to Sendmail
in order to see -- even in excruciating detail -- what's going on
at every stage of the delivery process. See the documentation
for ideas.
<h3>
<a name="bounce">
Do You Get a Bounce Message?
</a></h3>
<p>
If things work out okay this far, chances are the problem is not
with Procmail itself anymore. Some possibilities:
<dl>
<dt>	Procmail was compiled for the wrong architecture
<dd>	You would see something like "unknown mailer error 1"
in the bounce message if this is the case
(but this message will of course vary between architectures)
<dt>	Something in the <code>.procmailrc</code> file is wrong
<dd>	If you get a log file, examining that should be helpful
</dl>
<p>
If you get really desperate, you could always add various debugging aids
to either the <code>.forward</code> file or to your <code>.procmailrc</code>,
if things get as far as to actually starting up Procmail. The second
alternative is vastly preferrable; logging diagnostics directly from the
<code>.forward</code> file is always hairy.
<p>
A thread from the Procmail mailing list which touches on this briefly
is at
<a href="http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/procmail/1997-09/msg00526.html">http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/procmail/1997-09/msg00526.html</a>
-- the mailing list will obviously have lots of other old threads
about troubleshooting different scenarios; try a search for e.g. some
string you get in the bounce message and see if you get any promising
matches.
<p>
The first half of this page also has some
<a href="#examining">remarks on logging.</a>
<h2>
<a name="links">

The new Kernighan / Pike book has a

parts of which is available on-line.

If you thought this was boring, you'll hate the
<a href="http://www.iki.fi/era/procmail/">Procmail FAQ</a>
by yours truly. It comes with an even more boring
<a href="http://www.iki.fi/era/procmail/links.html">even more extensive links page,</a>
too.
<p>
And then there's
<a href="http://www.procmail.org/">http://www.procmail.org/</a>
and the
<a href="http://www.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de/mailing-lists/procmail/">searchable archive of the Procmail mailing list</a>
where you can look for problems similar to your own.
