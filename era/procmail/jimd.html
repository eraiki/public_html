    &#62; 
    I have a somewhat urgent need to start using <i>procmail</i> to
    bounce unwanted 
    mail (harassment) back to its source, with a few lines of warning
    text.  
    I understand from my ISP's tech spt that <i>procmail</i> is ideal for
    this (among many other things).  They have version 3.11pre3
    installed. 
</blockquote>

	Your ISP is very astute.

<blockquote>
    &#62;
    I would really appreciate some quick-start help getting this set
    up, then I'll fine tune and expand my use of procmail later, and
    when proficient, come in here and help other newbies.
</blockquote>

	I'll presume you have a shell account with your ISP.
	Log in and issue the command<tt> man procmailex</tt>

<p>

	This will show you the procmail examples page.  There are 
	a couple of other manual pages for procmail.  Usually you
	can issue the command<tt> man -k procmail</tt> to find the
        rest of them.

<blockquote>
    &#62;
    I am familiar with the concepts of filtering mail, if using
    Eudora's filters can qualify for that.  ...
</blockquote>

	Here's the short form for how procmail works:

<dl><dd>
		Unix mail systems consist of MTA's (mail 
		transport agents like sendmail, smail, qmail
		mmdf etc), MDA's (delivery agents like
		sendmail, deliver, and procmail), and MUA's
		(user agents like elm, pine, /bin/mail, mh,
		Eudora, and Pegasus).
<p>
		On most Unix systems on the Internet 'sendmail'
		is used as an integrated transport and delivery
		agent.  'sendmail' and compatible MTA's 
		have the ability to dispatch mail <em>through</em> a 
		custom filter or program through either of 
		two mechanisms: aliases and .forwards.  
<p>		
		The aliases mechanism uses a single file
		(usually <code>/etc/aliases</code> or <code>/usr/lib/aliases</code>)
		to redirect mail.  This file is owned and 
		maintained by the system administrator.
		Therefore you (as a user) can't modify it.
<p>
		The ".forward" mechanism is decentralized.
		Each user on the system can create a file
		in their home directory named .forward
		and consisting of an address, a filename,
		or a program.  Usually the file <em>must</em> be
		owned by the user or root and <em>must not</em> be 
		"writeable" by other users (good versions of
		sendmail check these factors for security 
		reasons).  
<p>		
		It's also possible, with some versions of 
		sendmail, for you to specify multiple addresses,
		programs, or files, separated with commas.  However
		we'll skip the details of that.
<p>
		You could forward your mail through any 
		arbitrary program with a <code>.forward</code> that consisted
		of a line like:
<pre>
    "|$HOME/bin/your.program"
</pre>
		Note the quotes and the "pipe" character. They are
		required.
<p>
		Now -- rather than saddling you with all details
		for how "your.program" would have to work -- what
		format sendmail would pass information to you, 
		how you would return values to sendmail, how you'd
		handle file locking (in case more mail came in while
		you were processing the last one, etc) -- we'll move
		along to procmail specifically.
<p>
		What I've discussed so far is the general information
		that applies to all sendmail-compatible MTA/MDA's.
<p>
		One note that is well worth making is that although
		sendmail is designed and often run as an integrated
		transport and delivery, it's possible to configure
		a system to use procmail as the delivery agent
		(most of the popular Linux distributions default to 
		this configuration, including Slackware, Red Hat, and
		Caldera).
<p>
		In this scenario sendmail passes local mail to 
		procmail.  This makes things marginally easier
		as we'll soon see.
<p>
		Assuming that your ISP is not so configured, you 
		must create a <code>.forward</code> file to get sendmail to 
		pass each incoming mail to procmai.
<p>
		Here's the canonical example, pasted right out of 
		the man pages:
<pre>
    "|IFS=' '&&exec /usr/local/bin/procmail -f-||exit 75 #YOUR_USERNAME"
</pre>
		This seems awfully complicated compared to my
		earlier example.  That's because my example was
		flawed for simplicity's sake.
<p>
		What this mess means to sendmail (paraphrasing into
		English) is:
<dl><dd><p>
			Pipe the mail to the following command(s):
<p>
			Set the "inter-field seperator" (IFS) to a 
			space, and -- if that went O.K. (&&) execute
			the program named "/usr/local/bin/procmail"
<p>
			(yours may need to be different -- someone
			at primenet should tell you where their 
			copy of procmail is installed, or you can try
			the command <code>which procmail</code> to see if it's
			on the patch or <code>locate procmail</code> if they
			are maintaining a file locator database).
<p>
			The procmail program is being passed a 
			set of switches: "-f-" which tells it to
			"update timestamp in the leading the 'From'
			line in the header"
<p>
			(this last bit is rather obscure and has
			to do with how messages are normally 
			stored in your "incoming" or mail file
			or "spool" as we Unix hacks like to call it).
<p>
			The next part of this .forward command is
			the Bourne shell's "||" operator which is
			basically a continuation from the "and" 
			(&&) operator that we used before.  It
			says "or" (if that command didn't work --
			i.e. it returned any error) than "exit"
			(stop processing) and return an error
			number 75 (which we presume is meaningful
			to sendmail -- the program that called
			this command).
<p>
			The last part of this <code>.forward</code> expression
			is a comment which, according to the man
			pages,
<blockquote><i>
             is not actually a parameter that is required by proc-
	     mail,  in fact, it will be discarded by sh before procmail
	     ever sees it; it is however  a  necessary  kludge  against
	     overoptimising sendmail programs:
</i></blockquote>
	     		(quoting from it)
<blockquote><i>
			You should just change the phrase YOUR_NAME
			to your login name on that system.

</i></blockquote>
		This complicated line can be just pasted into most
		<code>.forward</code> files, minimally edited and forgotten.
<p>
		If you did this and nothing else your mail would
		basically be unaffected.  procmail would just 
		append new messages into your normal spool file.
<p>
		If your ISP uses procmail as its local delivery
		agent then you can skip the whole part of about
		using the .forward file -- or you can use it anyway.
<p>
		In either event the next step to automating your
		mail handling is to create a <code>.procmailrc</code> file in 
		your home directory.  You could actually call 
		this file anything you wanted -- but then you'd
		have to slip the name explicitly into the <code>.forward</code>
		file (right before the "||" operator).  If you use
		<code>.procmailrc</code> than procmail will default to using it.
<p>
		Now we can get to a specific example.  So far, all
		we've talked about it how everything gets routed
		to procmail -- which mostly involves sendmail and 
		the Bourne shell's syntax.  Almost all sendmails
		are configured to use <code>/bin/sh</code> (the Bourne shell)
		to interpret alias and <code>.forward</code> "pipes."
<p>

		So, here's a very simple <code>.procmailrc</code> file:
<pre>
			:0c
			$HOME/mail.backup
</pre>
		This just appends an extra copy of all incoming 
		mail to a file named <code>mail.backup</code> in your 
		home directory.
<p>
		Note that a bunch of environment variable are preset
		for you.
<p>
		The :0  line marks the beginning of a "recipe"
		(procedure, clause, whatever).  :0 can be followed
		be any of a number of "flags."  There is a literally
		dizzying number of ways to combine these flags.  The
		one flag we're using in this example is 'c' for
		"copy."  
<p>
		The way procmail works is to start parsing 
		it's set of recipes from the beginning of the
		<code>.procmailrc</code> file, through any INCLUDE'd files
		until a message has been "delivered" (or 
		"disposed of" as the case may be).  Any recipe 
		can be a "disposition" or "delivery" of the message.
		As soon as a message is "delivered" then procmail
		closes its files, removes its locks and exits.
<p>
		If procmail reaches the end of its rc file
		(and thus all of the INCLUDE'd files) without
		"disposing" of the message -- than the message
		is appended to your spool file (which looks
		like a normal delivery to you and all of your
		"mail user agents" like Eudora, elm, etc).
<p>
		This explains why procmail is so forgiving
		if you have <em>no</em> <code>.procmailrc</code>.  It simply
		delivers your message to the spool because
		it has reached the end of all its recipes
		(there were none).
<p>
		The 'c' flag causes a recipe to work on a "copy"
		of the message -- meaning that any actions
		taken by that recipe are not considered to be
		"dispositions" of the message.  
<p>		
		Without the 'c' flag this recipe would catch 
		all incoming messages, and all your mail would 
		end up in <code>mail.backup</code>.  None of it would get 
		into your spool file and none of the other recipes 
		would be parsed.
<p>
		The next line in this sample recipe is simply
		a filename.  Like sendmail's aliases and <code>.forward</code>
		files -- procmail recognizes three sorts of 
		disposition to any message.  You can append it 
		to a file, forward it to some other mail address,
		or filter it through a program.  
<p>		
		Actually there is one special form of "delivery" 
		or "disposition" that procmail handles.  If you
		provide it with a directory name (rather than a
		filename) it will add the message to that directory
		as a separate file.  The name of that file will be
		based on several rather complicated factors that
		you don't have to worry about unless you use
		the Rand MH system, or some other relatively 
		obscure and "exotic" mail agent.
<p>
		A procmail recipe generally consists of three
		parts -- a start line (:0 with some flags) some
		conditions (lines starting with a '*' -- asterisk --
		character) and one "delivery" line which can be 
		file/directory name or a line starting with a '!' --
		bang -- character or a '|' -- pipe character.
<p>
		Here's another example:
<pre>
			:0
			* ^From.*someone.i.dont.like@somewhere.org
			/dev/null
</pre>
		This is a simple one consisting of no flags,
		one condition and a simple file delivery.  It simply
		throws away any mail from "someone I don't like."
		(/dev/null under Unix is a "bit bucket" -- a bottomless
		well for tossing unwanted output. DOS has a similar
		concept but it's not nearly as handy).
<p>
		Here's a more complex one:
<pre>
			:0
			* !^FROM_DAEMON 
			* !^FROM_MAILER
			* !^X-Loop: myaddress@myhost.mydomain.org
			| $HOME/bin/my.script
</pre>
		This consists of a set of negative conditions (notice
		that the conditions all start with the '!' character).
		This means: for any mail that didn't come from a
		"daemon" (some automated process) and didn't come from
		a "mailer" (some other automated process) and which
		doesn't contain any header line of the form:
		"X-Loop: myadd...", send it through the script in
		my bin directory.
<p>
		I can put the script directly in the rc file
		(which is what most procmail users do most of the 
		time).  This script might do anything to the mail.
		In this case -- whatever it does had better be good
		because procmail will consider any such mail
		to be delivered and any recipes after this will
		only be reached by mail from DAEMON's, MAILER's
		and any mail with that particular X-Loop: line 
		in the header.
<p>
		These two particular FROM_ conditions are actually
		"special." They are preset by procmail and actually
		refer to a couple of rather complicated regular
		expressions that are tailored to match the sorts of
		things that are found in the headers of most mail
		from daemons and mailers.
<p>
		The X-Loop: line is a normal procmail condition.
		In the RFC822 document (which defines what e-mail
		headers should look like on the Internet) any line
		started with X- is a "custom" header.  This means
		that any mail program that wants to can add pretty
		much any X- line it wants.
<p>
		A common procmail idiom is to add an X-Loop: line
		to the header of any message that we send out --
		and to check for our own X-Loop: line before
		sending out anything.  This is to protect against
		"mail loops" -- situations where our mail gets
		forwarded or "bounced" back to us and we endlessly
		respond to it.
<p>
		Finally we've gotten to the stage where we can 
		give you the particular example that you asked
		for.  First we start a recipe with:
<pre>
		:0
</pre>
		... then we add the one condition you've described
<pre>
		* ^From.*harasser@spamhome.com
</pre>
<dl><dd>		(you'll have to change the address to suit
			your case).
</dl>
		... and we add a couple of conditions to avoid
		looping and to avoid responding to automated systems
<pre>
			* !^FROM_DAEMON 
			* !^FROM_MAILER
</pre>
		... and one more to prevent some tricky loop:
<pre>
			* !^X-Loop: myaddress@myhost.mydomain.org
</pre>
		... now we add a "disposition" -- the autoresponse.
<pre>
			| (formail -rk \
				-A "X-Loop: yourname@youraddress.com" \
				-A "Precendence: junk"; \
			   echo "Please don't send me any more mail";\
			   echo "This is an automated response";\
			   echo "I'll never see your message";\
			   echo "So, GO AWAY" ) | $SENDMAIL -t -oi
</pre>
		This is pretty complicated -- but here's how it works:
<dl><dd>
			The pipe character tells procmail that 
			it should launch a program and feed the 
			message to it.
<p>
			The open parenthesis is a Bourne shell construct
			that groups a set of commands in such a way as
			to combine the output from all of them into
			one "stream."  We'll explain this more later.
<p>
			The 'formail' command is a handy program that
			is included with the procmail package.  It
			"formats" mail header according to its 
			command line switches and its input.
<dl><dd>
				-rk tells 'formail' to format a
				"reply" and to "keep" the message
				body.
<p>
				The -A parameters tells formail
				to "add" the next parameter as a
				header line.  The parameters
				provided to the -A switch must be
				enclosed in quotes so the shell
				treats the whole string (spaces 
				and all) as single parameters.
<p>
				The backslashes at the end of each 
				line tell procmail mail to treat
				the next line as part of this one.
				So, all of the lines ending in 
				backslashes are passed to the shell
				as one long line.
<p>
				This "trailing backslash" or "line
				continuation" character is a common
				Unix idiom found in a number of 
				programming languages and configuration
				file formats.
<p>
				The semicolons tell the shell 
				to execute another command -- they
				allow several commands to be issued
				on the same command line.
<p>
				Each of the echo commands should be
				reasonably self-explanatory.  We
				could have used a 'cat' command
				and put our text into a file if we
				wanted.  We can also call other programs
				here -- like 'fortune' or 'date' --
				and their output would be combined with
				the rest of this).
<p>
				Now we get to the closing parenthesis.
				This marks the end of the block of 
				commands that we combined.  The output
				from all of those is fed into the 
				next pipe -- which starts the local
				copy of sendmail (note that this is
				another variable that procmail 
				thoughtfully presets for us).
<p>
				The -t switch on sendmail tells it to 
				take the "To:" address from the header 
				of its input (where 'formail -r' put
				it) and the -oi switch enables the
				sendmail "option" to "ignore" lines
				that consist only of a 'dot' (don't
				worry about the details on that).
</dl><p>
		This is basically the recipe you want.
		Obviously it has to be modified a bit.  That's 
		why I've gone to such elaborate lengths to explain
		<em>how</em> it all works.
<p>
		Most of the difficulty in understanding procmail
		has nothing to do with procmail itself.  The intricacies
		of regular expressions (those weird things on the
		'*' -- conditional lines) and shell quoting and 
		command syntax, and how to format a reply header that
		will be acceptable to sendmail (the 'formail' and 
		'sendmail' stuff) are the parts that require so 
		much explanation.

<blockquote>
    &#62;
    This system works very well, but anyone who knows how to read the
    message header of the reply can see that their messages are from
    Eudora, and therefore are getting to my system, and they probably
    figure the messages are being read anyway.  This tends to encourage,
    rather than discourage them. 
</blockquote>

		Or they know that it's taking up diskspace on 
		your provider and bandwidth and time on your phone.
<p>
		It sounds like you should also consider contacting
		the postmaster at this person's ISP.  If the person
		harassing you <em>is</em> the postmaster (or owner) of
		the domain from which this harassment is occuring
		you can contact the postmaster at the site which 
		provides MX and DNS services to them (look in 
		'whois' for that or continue to complain to the
		postmaster at your site (primenet).
<p>
		Note that, in some jurisdictions, you may also have
		legal recourse.  I believe there was a decision
		last year that held that e-mail is legally equivalent
		to a fax machine -- and there are laws regarding 
		unsolicited faxes.  You may want to search the 
		web for some details and talk to a lawyer.
<p>
		I've found that a message to the effect that:
<blockquote>
		 Your message to me was unsolicited and not
		 relevant to any of my personal or business activities.
		 Please don't not send me any more mail.  Any further
		 mail from you will be considered harassment and may
		 result in legal actions against your and/or your
		 e-mail provider.
</blockquote>
		 ... sent to the offender and his/her postmaster
		 is very effective.  I don't ever remember getting
		 hit by the same spammer twice when I've fired off
		 one of these.

<blockquote>
    &#62;
    I'd like to make this filtering (just for this one type of
    message) and  autoresponse happen on the server, so the messages
    don't even get to my system.
</blockquote>

	That's what procmail is for.

<blockquote>
    &#62;
    I am somewhat familiar with UNIX (was a self-taught UNIX System
    Administrator by necessity at one job for a year and a half).  I
    use some UNIX when telnetting to my home directory - created a
    .plan file, can get around in the command prompt (ksh), have
    transferred files, and have several web pages.  So, at least I'm
    not a totally ignorant novice. 
</blockquote>

	I did go into quite a bit of additional detail for 
	the benefit of the rest of the list -- and anyone in the
	future who bothers to check the archives before they post.
<p>
	I'm currently writing a book (actually revising one into
	a second edition) on the subject of Unix System Administration.
	I've also casually discussed writing a book on procmail and
	SmartList with O'Reilly & Associates and Stephen.
<p>
	This message will go into my archives where parts of it 
	may be used in either or both of these projects.

<blockquote>
    &#62;
    Not to be critical of all the very fine work, but the procmail man
    page and what I've seen on Alan Stebbens' E-Mail Software Page are
    not geared for someone in my position.  They, like so much
    documentation out there, are good as a reference for someone who
    already knows how to do it - and could be used to get started
    after a very lengthy analysis and study of the mass of technical
    information.  
</blockquote>

	The best info on mailbots that I've found used to be 
	maintained by Nancy McGough (sp??) at the Infinite Ink
	web pages:

<blockquote>
    &#62;
    To me, a recipe is something used in the kitchen, not on my
    computer - and I haven't seen anything out there that simply tells
    you what a procmail recipe really is and where it goes (recipe is
    just one example), so you can at least get an idea of what's going
    on. 
</blockquote>

	I hope that, after reading this, you can't say that any more.

<blockquote>
    &#62;
    I need to get my feet wet with a simple installation, get an
    overall understanding of how the whole thing is structured, then
    build on it gradually.  Can someone help?
</blockquote>

	I hope I have.   If you really get stuck give me a 
	call -- I also do consulting and have written auto-responders
	for companies like "Cybermedia" (publishers of First Aid for
	Windows).
<p>
	Mail to info@starshine.org will get a response.
	(Not a terribly well written response -- just something
	I tossed together in less than a tenth of the time I just
	spent on this e-mail.  If I needed more work I'd spend
	more time on that and my web pages).

    &#62;
    Thank you very much in advance.

	You're welcome.
