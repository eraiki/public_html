Hey, I'm no guru - in fact I'm just a newbie with procmail!  I started
using it in November... but I must admit that I'm now able to use it
with some good effect. :)


<blockquote>

Absolutely simple to do.  For example, this is a procmail recipe to
strip out trailing spaces on every message:

<blockquote><pre>
# --- strip all trailing spaces ---
#
:0fW
| sed -e 's+ *$++'
</pre></blockquote>

Here's a more complex one that filters any Quoted-Printable messages
to turn them into ordinary 8bit...

<blockquote><pre>
# --- do mime filtering if it is quoted-printable ---
#
:0fW
* ^Content-Transfer-Encoding: QUOTED-PRINTABLE
| emil -f 2 -l 2 -u -C ISO-8859-1 -F RFC822 -H 8bit -T 8bit
	:0 Afhw
	| formail -I "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit" \
		  -I "X-Converted: Quoted-Printable to 8bit"
</pre></blockquote>

The actual mechanics of how `emil' works is not really relevant here,
but it does show you how it is done... any message with that
Content-Transfer-Encoding line will get sent though the filter (and
then to formail to add the extra header lines).  Neither of them
are delivery recipes, so procmail will continue to process the
messages after this point.

<p>

Here's another that I do for every incoming mail...


<blockquote><pre>
# --- strip out ugly PGP stuff ---
#
:0fbW
* (BEGIN|END) PGP (SIG(NATURE|NED MESSAGE)|PUBLIC KEY BLOCK)
| sed -e 's+^- -+-+' \
      -e '/BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE/d' \
      -e '/BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE/,/END PGP SIGNATURE/d' \
      -e '/BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK/,/END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK/d'
	:0 Afhw
	| formail -I "X-PGP: PGP Signature stripped"
</pre></blockquote>

Do you get the general idea?

<p>

(Note the `b' flag... it only filters the <em>body</em> of the message).

<blockquote>

	&#62; procmail is the local delivery agent for my sendmail
	on Linux, so it is being called (without any rc file) on every
	piece of mail anyway.
</blockquote>

Cool.  All you have to do to get procmail to start filtering is to
create a ~/.procmailrc file and create recipes like these in it.

<blockquote>
	&#62; I would like to do things like delete
	excessive email signatures
</blockquote>

Difficult to do "generically"... what sort of <em>reliable</em> criteria can
you use to detect such sigs, and how do you go about removing just the
.sig part reliably?

<blockquote>
	&#62; and automatically add X-No-Archive: yes for certain
	privacy-concerned members of a mailing list I own.
</blockquote>

Adding headers is one of the things formail is useful for.  Both of
the above recipes filter the messages though formail depending on what
the result of the immediately preceding recipe is.  (See the man
pages).

<p>

The real secret is understanding exactly what the flags are for, and
what you are able to do with them.  (Eg, lookup <code>:0fBw</code> and
<code>:0Afhw</code> in
the procmailrc man page).

<blockquote>
	&#62; I see how to get things flowing into the filter (sed or
	whatever). 
</blockquote>

If the message isn't delivered by a recipe, then it will continue to
be processed.

<blockquote>
	&#62; I am totally lost how I get it going back into the
	default mailbox. 
</blockquote>

Use the `c' flag.  Well, use it on a deliver recipe when you still
want a copy of the message to continue to be processed.

<p>

After all the filtering occurs and there are no more recipes to be
processed, if the message hasn't been delivered, then procmail will
put the message into the default mailbox file.  (And you have
control over what that is by setting the appropriate environment
varialbes for procmail in the ~/.procmailrc file - again, see the man
pages).

<p>

A delivery recipe can be as simple as this:

<blockquote><pre>
:0:
* ^From( |: ).*procmail
procmail
</pre></blockquote>

which will (in general) put all mail matching a From: or From_ line
that has come from the procmail list, and append it into a file called
`procmail'.  Note the second colon after the :0: - it signifies that a
lockfile should be used.  Lockfiles are, in general, not needed for
filtering recipes.

<p>

If all that is needed to be matched in such a recipe is a header line,
then you can make things more specific by adding a `H' flag, eg:

<blockquote><pre>
:0H:
* ^From( |: ).*procmail
procmail
</pre></blockquote>

This will look for the specified match only in the <em>header</em> of the
message, rather than the <em>entire</em> message.  You can do similar things
with the body using `B'.
<br><small>
(The implied default is `H'. Use `HB' to search both header and body. // era)
</small>

<p>

If you still want to process the message from here even if the file
has been delivered somewhere, then add a `c' flag, eg, :0c:  I use
such a recipe for detecting and placing aside any duplicate messages
(eg, the same message delivered to me as Cc to two lists I'm
subscribed to, or Cc'ed to me AND a mailing list)...

<blockquote><pre>
# --- handle duplicate email ---
# 
MESG_ID=mesg_id.cache
:0 Whc: $MESG_ID.lock
| formail -D 196608 $MESG_ID
	:0 a:
	IN.duplicates
</pre></blockquote>

See how the `c' flag is used?  Here's a more explicit example...

<blockquote><pre>
:0c:
IN.backup
</pre></blockquote>

At this point, procmail will unconditionally put a copy of any message
it is processing into a file called IN.backup, but also continue to
process the message for any further action.


<blockquote>
	&#62; Also, somehow procmail divides the mail into a header piece and a
	body piece.  I am unclear how a filter works on one or the other,
	and how the two pieces get put back together when the filter
	is done.
</blockquote>

You use the flags `H', `h', `B' and `b' for doing that, like I
mentioned above.

<blockquote>
	&#62; Would you have any example of how to get that to work for the
	procmail as the system's local mail delivery agent?  This is
	probably in the documentation, but I don't see it.  :-(
</blockquote>

It's there alright...

<p>

If sendmail is using procmail as the local deliver agent, then you
tell procmail what to do on a per-user basis with the user's
~/.procmailrc file... procmail will look for such a file and start to
read it automatically.

<p>

On a system-wide basis (before delivery to any user), you use the
/etc/procmailrc [whatever] files (see the man pages) - but I haven't
got procmail set up to use any system-wide files myself, just per-user.
Check the man pages for more details.

<p>

Once again, I can't stress enough that it is the <em>flags</em> you specify
for any individual recipe that will largely determine what procmail
will do as a result of executing it.  So check the procmailrc man page
carefully for what these do.  Sooner or later the penny will drop and
it will start to make sense.

<p>

Experiment by sending "dummy" messages to procmail with VERBOSE=yes,
and see what happens.  EG..

<blockquote><pre>
% formail -s procmail &#60; mailbox
</pre></blockquote>

formail will break the mailbox file up into separate messages for
procmail to act on.  Procmail will execute, by default, the
~/.procmailrc file.

<blockquote><pre>
% formail -s procmail -m experimental.rc
</pre></blockquote>

This will do the same thing, but will use the file `experimental.rc'
as its rc file instead of ~/.procmailrc.

You can specify the procmail log file in the rc files and set
VERBOSE=yes.  Then you can use the `tail -f' command to watch what's
going on....

<blockquote><pre>
% tail -f ~/.procmail.log &
</pre></blockquote>

This is a very useful thing to do... `tail -f' will continue to read a
file and display it as it is being added to, and by sending the
process into the background you can get it to continue to do that
while you test things out using the same shell and tty/console.  Neat
trick (I use it a lot for following what's happening to certain system
log files).

<p>

Hope this helps.

<p>

Cheers<br>
Tony
