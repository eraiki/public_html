This is a draft FAQ for Procmail, the mail processing utility. 
<p>
This document is a minimalist attempt at answering the most often
asked questions and straightening out the most frequent misconceptions
about Procmail. This is no substitute for the manuals, and indeed
mostly contains pointers to the manuals and other similar resources, as
well as a small collection of links to more information.

What is Procmail? 
</h2></a>
<h3>
Description, availability, and installation
</h3>
Procmail is a mail processing utility, which can help you filter your
mail, sort incoming mail according to sender, Subject line, length of
message, keywords in the message, implement an ftp-by-mail server, and
much more. 
<p>
Procmail is also a complete drop-in replacement for your MDA. 
(If this doesn't mean anything to you, you don't want to know.)
<p>
Procmail runs under Unix. See Infinite Ink's <a href="http://www.jazzie.com/ii/internet/mailbots.html">Mail Filtering and Robots page</a>
for information about related utilities for other platforms 
(there aren't that many). 
<p>
The recommended version of Procmail to install is 
<strong>
3.11pre4
</strong>.
You can download it from the <a href="ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail/">main Procmail site</a>
or get it from a <tt>comp.sources.unix</tt> mirror. 
<blockquote>
[The documentation stated new versions would get posted
to <tt>comp.sources.misc</tt> long after Stephen had
stopped doing this. Of course, I even got the newsgroup
wrong.]
</blockquote>
The installation procedure is fairly straightforward but probably not
the first thing you should attempt after you get a Unix account. 
<p>
You can't just snatch somebody's copy, because the installation
procedure needs to determine where your mail spool is, what kinds of
file locking should be employed, etc. 
<p>
The distribution comes with a 
<a href="faq.txt">simple FAQ</a>
(text only, no HTML)
which covers many issues faced when first getting acquainted with
Procmail, ranging from where the manual pages go to rather technical
issues. 
<p>
This FAQ does not try to delve into any of the "deep" issues, although
some of them are rather frequently brought up on the Procmail mailing
list. You might want to look at the <a href="http://www-users.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~berg/archive/procmail">Best of Procmail archive</a>
for solutions before you mail the list about your problem.
<p>
<h3> Related quick questions </h3>
<strong>Q:</strong>
What if Procmail is already installed by another user on my host? 
<p>
<strong>A:</strong>
Could be. Ask around. Yes, one installation per site should suffice.
<p>
<a name="syntax"><h2>
How do I use wildcards in Procmail? 
</h2></a>
<h3>
... and other syntax issues
</h3>
Procmail uses regular expression syntax, which is more complicated but
also vastly more versatile than the "glob" wildcards used in many
shells for matching file names (where pr*mail matches anything which
starts with "pr" and ends with "mail"). 
<p>
Briefly, the regular expression to match anything that begins with
"pr" and ends with "mail" is <code>^pr.*mail$</code> but for practical
purposes, e.g. in a Subject: line, you might want to try the following
recipe:
<blockquote><pre>
:0:
* ^Subject: pr.*mail
procmail-mail
</pre></blockquote>
This says: Anything that begins with "Subject: pr" and contains the
string "mail" somewhere after that is to be saved in the folder
<code>procmail-mail</code>. 
<p>
The neat stuff starts when you want to include "procmail" but exclude
"pro-mail" and "ProMail" while still looking for anything else that
begins with "pro" and also contains "mail", but this tutorial ends
here. 
<p>
Any beginners' book about Unix will contain a more detailed tutorial
on regular expressions, most likely in conjunction with examples using
the <code>grep</code> and <code>sed</code> programs. For reference,
the manual page for <code>egrep</code> (an extended <code>grep</code>)
contains a concise listing of regular expression operators. 
<p>
<h3>Related quick questions</h3>
<strong>Q:</strong>
Wouldn't it be much simpler to just use glob-like patterns? 
Does this mean I have to learn something new again? Ugh. 
<p>
<strong>A:</strong>
Yes. Don't bother with Procmail if you want something simple and stupid. 
<p>
<strong>Q:</strong>
Why doesn't this work? 
<blockquote><pre>
:0:
* ^TO:.*|*reguler ixpressiun full of synutsax errors as weel as typoes**.*
! mailto:dev@null  # this isnt correct is it? Help!
</pre></blockquote>
<blockquote>
[I'm sorry, but at the time, I thought this was hilarious.
I guess I still do&nbsp;<code>:-]</code>
</blockquote>
<strong>A:</strong>
Various syntax errors notwithstanding (read the manual), 
you shouldn't use a wildcard after the ^TO macro. Try this: 
<blockquote><pre>
:0 # no need to lock /dev/null ...
* ^TOregular expression without syntax errors or typos
/dev/null
</pre></blockquote>

Troubleshooting tips
</h3>
<blockquote>The light bulb contains the seeds of its own revolution.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
[This is the punch line from the old joke
"How many Marxists does it take to change a light bulb?"
Another case where I just couldn't help myself, I'm afraid.
As a matter of fact, it's still in the FAQ, for hysterical reasons,
although I don't expect many people will appreciate it.
Anyway, it's supposed to mean
"You can and should learn to help yourself."]
</blockquote>
Before you panic, try adding <code>VERBOSE=yes</code> to your
<code>.procmailrc</code> and examine the information about Procmail's
actions that are written to the log. This tells you, in excruciating
detail, about every decision Procmail makes while processing your
<code>rc</code> file. 
<p>
The error messages and some plausible explanations are listed on the
Procmail manual page. If you haven't before, now is the time to read
the manual pages. Note that there are several; <code>procmailrc</code>
discusses the syntax of the <code>rc</code> files while
<code>procmailex</code> contains some nifty examples.

<ul>
<li>
The definitive links and information collection is Infinite Ink's
site. Start at the <a href="http://www.jazzie.com/ii/internet/mailbots.html">Mail Filtering and Robots page</a> -- you'll find
lots of Procmail-related links, as well as lots of other useful
information. 
<li>
Procmail itself can be downloaded from the <a href="ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail/">main Procmail site</a>. 
<li>
Also check out the <a href="http://www-users.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~berg/archive/procmail">Best of Procmail archive</a>. 
<li>
<a href="http://reality.sgi.com/aks/mail/procmail-lib.html">Alan Stebbens's Procmail library</a> is very useful both as a direct
plug-in and as an example of advanced Procmail techniques. You'll find
all the autoresponders you ever thought you wanted, and then some.
Highly recommended!
