<h1>Unix and shell programming stuff</h1>
Here's a kitchen-sink collection of Unix-related stuff, 
including an Emacs section and some Procmail links. 
I've tried to only collect links of reasonable quality, 
but unfortunately, link rot in these
circles is really bad. If you find any broken links here, 
please let me know -- <a href="http://www.iki.fi/era/feedback.html">mail me</a>. 
<p>
My private Procmail pages are not yet up; for now, have a look
at the
<a href="../procmail/index.html">Procmail FAQ I maintain.</a>

Unix History
</a></h3>
<p>
The Unix community has a rather strong interest in its own history.
I have tried to gather some retro-Unix stuff and links to good stories
here.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr">Dennis Ritchie's home page</a>
has a lot of interesting historical material.
Many classic papers and fun anecdotes.
<li>
<a name="vol2">
I happened to stumble over
</a><a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/7thEdMan/">the Bell Labs apocryphal sources </a>
for the Unix 7th Edition manuals.
The original Bourne Shell tutorial in this package,
by Steve Bourne, is available in a 
<a href="shell.html">HTMLized version I made.</a>
<li>
<a name="44bsd">

are available from
<a href="http://docs.freebsd.org/">the FreeBSD Documentation site</a>
(along with a whole lot of other interesting stuff).
It's supposed to be up-to-date documentation,
but a lot of the articles are classical ones
inherited from the good ol' eighties
(and frankly speaking, some of them
have quite clearly not been updated
since then).

<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/upe">The Unix Programming Environment,</a>
<nobr>(Kernighan &#38; Pike 1984)</nobr>
<dd>
Old but nevertheless good.
An excellent primer on
shell programming, but also
includes a lot of stuff
not related to shell programming,
such as Make, Troff, and
the Unix standard library
(for C programmers etc).
<dd>
The
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/upe/errata.html">errata page</a>

by yours truly :-)
<dt>
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/tpop">The Practice of Programming</a>
<nobr>(Kernighan &#38; Pike 1999)</nobr>
<dd>
Good programming habits;
examples in C, Java, and Perl.
Not particularly Unix-centric
(actually I believe
the authors use Plan 9)
but very much on the
right wavelength for
anybody who likes Unix.
<dt>

<dd>
C programming
and the library;
explains and relates to
various standards
such as POSIX,
XPG3 (now XPG4, of course),
SVID, etc.
(Somewhat ignorant
of Linux, but that's
probably only
for the better.)

<a href="http://www.phptr.com/ptrbooks/ptr%5F0130206016.html">Unix System Administration Handbook</a>

<dd>
I don't yet own the 3rd edition,
but I own a copy of the 1st
and 2nd eds.
<dd>
The new edition now also covers
Red Hat and FreeBSD,
where the
<a href="http://www.phptr.com/ptrbooks/ptr%5F0131510517.html">previous edition</a>
was predominantly
"expensive" vendors
(HP-UX, Irix, OSF/1,

SunOS, and BSDI).

<h3>
<a name="gnu">
GNU Utilities
</a></h3>
<p>
A constant need for many is to find Unix shell utilities which do not
stink. Frequently user-level software on many platforms is written to
barely conform to spec, so that the programmers can spend more time to
introduce new and better incompabilities with the competition in their
kernel-level code.
<p>
I have found the GNU utilities to generally be robust, user-friendly
(in the Unix sense, i.e. if you know what you're doing, it's doable),
mostly devoid of unnecessary restrictions (both in terms of who's
allowed to use and copy them and in what input they will accept) and
often simply much better than what Sun, HP, Digital, NetBSD (which is
otherwise very nice) and generally everyone else would want you to
have. (Linux comes with GNU utilities preinstalled by default.)
<p>
There's a sort of web page at
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">http://www.gnu.org/</a>
but it doesn't contain very much about the
GNU packages I'd like to see introductions to.
Perhaps you should just cruise around in 
<a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/">ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/</a>
(or one of the many many mirrors worldwide)
and see what you find.

<h2>
<a name="emacs">
Emacs

<p>
Of course, Emacs isn't Unix, and Unix isn't Emacs, but people who
recognize quality tend to like both.
(See also

<p>
A great part of this section is just stuff I cut &amp;&amp; pasted out of the

<dd>	Other gripes:
<ul>
<li>	It's too big and slow
(I used to think so about v2, but look at v4!)
<li>	The next version inevitably breaks things that
worked fine in the previous version that you 
had learned to rely on
<li>	... and the key bindings keep a-changin', 
forget about "plug and play" upgrades, 
it's a major reconfiguration and relearning
experience each time
</ul>
<dd>	Still, it's better than <i>not</i> having a browser 
inside Emacs.
<dt>
<a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net/networking/mail/vm/">VM</a>
the mail reading package
<dd>	My gripes:
<ul>
<li>
<dl>
<dt> It is not "extensible"
<dd>
Lots of menus etc are defined with
<code>defconst</code> so you can't
customize things without a lot of
workarounds.
</dl>
<li>
<dl>
<dt> It is not "self-documenting"
<dd>
Looking for documentation for what
a particular function does?
Forget it. It's not there.
</dl>
<li>
<dl>
<dt> It is not "programmable"
<dd>
This is a corollary of
the two previous items.
There is nothing there to
prevent you from trying,
<i>per se</i>, but you need
to be masochistic or stupid
or very very bored
if you want to try to do
anything serious.
</dl>
</ul>
It's still a lot better than RMAIL,
or than using something else than Emacs
as your mail environment.

"Unix is the ultimate computer virus"
<dd>
Ironically, the guy who coined the phrase
"Unix is the ultimate computer virus"
was rather critical of Unix and C.
The guy is Richard P. Gabriel
and the quotation is from his 1992 paper
<a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/docs/articles/good-news/good-news.html">Lisp: Good News - Bad News - How to Win Big</a>
<dt>
... which brings us to the

Don't be fooled by the silly name, this is not

Some of the criticism is very insightful.

Of course, this contains a Useless Use of Test!
<blockquote><pre>
	if test -z `ps -fe | grep whom` 
	then 
		echo ^G 
 	fi 
	# Let's see for whom the bell tolls. 
</pre></blockquote>
Or is it Useless Use of Backticks? Anyhow, the way to code that is
<blockquote><pre>
	if ps -fe | grep whom; then ...
</pre></blockquote>
Oh! And another one:
<blockquote><pre>
	cat menu | grep shrimp
</pre></blockquote>
Yes -- this is the classic

Other programs

Some of these are programs I use. Others are programs I don't use.
Some of these are programs I recommend. Others are programs I don't recommend.
You were warned.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~amc/Par/"><code>par</code></a>
is a program for reformatting paragraphs
(somewhat like the standard <code>fmt</code> utility, only smarter).
<li>
<a href="ftp://ftp.yars.free.net/pub/software/unix/net/ftp/client/lftp/"><code>lftp</code></a>
-- finally a decent command-line ftp client.
Good-bye, <code>ncftp</code> -- good riddance.
(Okay, so this one isn't exactly rock solid either.)
<li>
<a href="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/misc/old-hsu-archive/unsorted/8/sls.shar.gz"><code>sls</code></a>
is a hacker-friendly version of <b>ls</b><i>(1)</i> by Rich Baughman
for those times when you need a good simple interface to file sizes,
modification times, access times, etc. in a "less user friendly"
format&nbsp;<code>:-)</code> than you get with <code>ls</code>
<br>
I've been receiving requests for pointers to the original author
and/or a version without Y2K problems. I've been in touch with
the author and received a copy of his most recent source,
which does not have a Y2K problem, but still contains some Sunisms.
<br>
<strong>A patched version</strong>
with some contributed patches
is maintained by yours truly
and available from
<a href="http://www.iki.fi/era/unix/sls.tar.gz">http://www.iki.fi/era/unix/sls.tar.gz</a>
or just the diffs from the above in

(Somehow I originally thought this was a program by Rich $alz
but that is not the case.
Apologies to both Riches for the confusion.
Also, for a very long time,
the tarball was broken.
My sincerest apologies to everyone
who tried to download it
before December 2001.
I'm very embarrassed.)
<li>
<a href="http://www.inf.utfsm.cl/~vparada/webcopy.html"><code>webcopy</code></a>
is a simple but versatile tool for fetching web pages. I got this
in 1995, before <code>wget</code> was even conceived, but I find
this one still works better for me. (<code>wget</code> is incredibly
frustrating in some respects. I should perhaps put my rants about it
on a separate web page some day&nbsp;<code>:-)</code>
I note that many hosts on
<a href="http://www.pgp.net/"><code>pgp.net</code></a>
use <code>webcopy</code>, too, so I guess I'm not the only one who
likes this one.
